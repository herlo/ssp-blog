#### Lately, I've feel like I'm very busy trying to become busy

It's been a bit of a roller-coaster ride, and so far, being an independent consultant has been very fruitful for me.  Until mid-January, I was as busy as I ever wanted, sometimes too busy.  But time and time again, I've been reminded that there will be leaner times for me and Purple Atom, my new training and consulting start-up.

So far, it's just me and a couple contractors who I have known for some time that I have used for a couple small jobs.  But it seems the work has slowed for now.  While I know it will be back in a month or so, I've been trying to land more work, that's a bit like chasing one's own tail.

As I grow my business, I've wanted to keep a steady income and be able to do the gigs I've wanted to do.  Mind you, I'm in no world of hurt monetarily, it's just interesting to see my first real lull.  While I have a couple on-going contracts, I've not had any training gigs in almost a month.  And I have to say, it is nice and disconcerting at the same time.

I find myself doing a little each day to locate a new client, but most of my day is spent on projects I've previously ignored.  This is a good thing for my skillset and for the [Fedora Project][1], since that's where most of the work is going each day.  I'm the one giving me work, and I'm the one completing the work I've given myself.

#### It has been fun and useful

In late January, Jennifer and I took our little AJ to Tempe, Arizona.  I was heading there for the annual [FUDCon][2] conference, and Jennifer took AJ over to meet her extended family.  We spent eight (8) days travelling.  We travelled for two days, visited the Grand Canyon along the way.  Spent four (4) days in Tempe visiting family and attending FUDCon.  Our return over two days took us by the Hoover Dam and we stayed a night at the Luxor in Las Vegas.

When we returned, I've started to get into a routine of heading over to the [coffee shop][3] and working on one project or another.  Much of my time has been spent on personal projects.  I'm working on my own development project, [PyCamps][4].  I've also worked on [fpaste-server][5] and the [SCaLE FAD][6].

I also spent basically a whole day sorting out honeymoon plans.  Yes, that's right, I'm getting married to Jennifer on May 13, 2011.  I'm really only in charge of paying for things, but since I'm in charge, we're doing a real honeymoon too!

#### The future

[Purple Atom][7] is going well, but I want it to get to the vision I have for it.  I have some good partnerships for training and I love that part of my business.  The consulting part, however, I'd like to pare down and focus on helping small-to-medium sized companies build a better infrastructure.  There is much, much more to come about this, so if it interests you, stay tuned&#8230;

I know that in the next month, business will pick up with or without my pursuing other work. I'd like to think that I have the chops for this Entrepreneur thing, so I'm out looking for work.  If you know of anyone who is looking for a super-awesome-system-admin or needs help building or retooling an infrastructure, please [contact me][8], leave me a comment, etc.

Cheers,

Herlo
