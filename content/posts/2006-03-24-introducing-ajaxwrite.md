I wanted to talk a little bit about a new application I saw today called ajaxWrite. This little ditty is pretty dang cool You can find it at  <a target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://www.linspire.com/ajaxwrite.php">http://www.linspire.com/ajaxwrite.php</a>. This little ajax application claims to have many of the features (plus more to come) that currently reside in M$ word. So I tried it out and my results were pretty fantastic!!

I first just tried creating a new file, typing into the document, making things bold, underline, etc. Then I tried out the other features and while some of them don't work correctly yet (tables, outline), others work pretty well (fonts, undo, redo, save). Afterward, I was able to open some of my word docs into it pretty successfully, which is to say that the tables and alignment didn't come in correct, but everything else came in quite well from my limited testing.

I like the idea here, and its got a lot of potential. I really didn't see the benefit of the tables yet, because there is no way to put in cells, but hey its a start. I am sure it will get better as time goes on, so check it out and see what you can do with ajaxWrite today!!

Cheers,
