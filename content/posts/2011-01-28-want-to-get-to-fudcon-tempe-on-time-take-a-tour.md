If you are coming to [FUDCon Tempe][1] and have never been to the ASU campus, we don't want you to get lost. Let the FUDCon tour guides help you out on your way over to the barcamp pitches tomorrow morning.

Every 10 minutes, starting at 7:45am, meet in the lobby of the Courtyard Marriott.  You will be directed on a walking tour as we head toward the Center for Design North (CDN), also known as the Architecture and Environmental Design Building (AED).

On the tour, you will see the following items:

  * A short tour of Mill Avenue, with restaurants and pubs
  * The Brickyard Artisan Court (where the Barcamp sessions will be held)
  * The Center for Design North (where the Barcamp pitches will be held)

In addition to all this, you'll be on time to the barcamp pitches!  But don't miss out, the last tour will begin at 8:45 so we can all get there before 9am.

If you don't get the tour, you can still make it on your own.  Here's [a map][2] with information to make it simple and straightforward.  It's a google map and works well by searching for the url right in your maps program on a smart phone.

See you all tomorrow!

Cheers,

Herlo
