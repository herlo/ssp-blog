I was perusing today, and maybe its just because its April Fools day and I've not posted, but I thought this was pretty hilarious&#8230;

If you click to add a new calendar item into Google Calendar, you get a new button &#8220;I'm Feeling Lucky&#8221;&#8230;

After clicking this new button I recognized, here's what I got:

Woohoo!  So right before the Ubuntu/Fedora Release party on May 3, I have a date with Jessica Alba!  Nice!  I might blow off the release party if the date goes well&#8230;

I tried this a few more times and here's the results I've received.  I've got dates with:

  * Anna Kournikova on May 5 at 4pm
  * Eric Cartman on May 10 at 6pm
  * George W. Bush on May 6 at 4pm
  * Matt Damon on May 8 at 8pm

Wow!  I'm popular.  Who else, what else did you get?

Cheers,

Herlo
