Some of you may have seen my mailing list posts to <a href="http://sllug.org/pipermail/sllug-members/2007-October/009527.html" target="_blank">SLLUG</a>, <a href="http://plug.org/pipermail/plug/2007-October/027991.html" target="_blank">PLUG</a> and <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-us-ut/2007-October/000574.html" target="_blank">Ubuntu Utah</a>. If so, you are welcome to participate here and flame me for asking this question as you may have already answered it there.

**BUT**

I'm curious as to the history, a farce or truth as to why <a href="http://blootbot.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">blootbot</a> is considered a female in Utah? Is there some long truthful story that can be told, or is it that someone just decided? Is it like naming a boat? a hurricane? Call it a fascination, a fanaticism, crazy or whatever, I just want to know the history.

In a recent interview with TimRiker, the maintainer of blootbot, I asked him some tough, hard questions:

<pre>16:37 &lt;@herlo&gt; TimRiker: so do you know the history of why ibot/infobot/jbot is a girl?  I'd like to learn it...
16:46 &lt; TimRiker&gt; herlo: infobot is not a girl. well, not all the time.
16:46 &lt; goozbach&gt; don't let Charity hear that
16:46  * maquis sends an email to charity....
16:46 &lt; TimRiker&gt; is Charity a girl all the time? :)
16:46 &lt; TimRiker&gt; ~gender
16:46 &lt; infobot&gt; I'm hermaphroditic
16:46 &lt; TimRiker&gt; ~gender
16:46 &lt; infobot&gt; I'm hermaphroditic
16:46 &lt; TimRiker&gt; ~gender
16:46 &lt; infobot&gt; I'm female
16:46 &lt; TimRiker&gt; ~gender
16:46 &lt; infobot&gt; I'm pregnant
16:46 &lt; TimRiker&gt; ~gender
16:46 &lt; infobot&gt; I'm pregnant
16:46 &lt; TimRiker&gt; ~gender
16:46 &lt; infobot&gt; I'm gay
16:47 &lt; TimRiker&gt; etc.
16:47 &lt; TimRiker&gt; depends on her mood.</pre>

I'd like to hear your opinions, or share your fantastic story of how she became the woman she is today. We love our bot, we do, tell the infobot story&#8230;

Cheers,

Herlo
