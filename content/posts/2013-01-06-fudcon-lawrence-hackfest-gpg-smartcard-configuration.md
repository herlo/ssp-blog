As I've been working at my new job at the [Linux Foundation][1], we have been [implementing quite a bit of two-factor authentication][2]. In fact, back in November, [Fedora implemented two-factor authentication for sudo at the Security FAD][3]. I was there and helped setup the clients and did some testing.

While I was there, I had another agenda item, [creating a HOWTO for enabling a GPG SmartCard for use with SSH][4]. Of course, the SmartCard can be used for both encryption and signing as well.

After finishing that HOWTO, I was talking about it with a few people within Fedora, and there seemed to be quite a bit of interest. It turns out there was quite a bit of interest, so I've decided to do a hackfest on [Saturday at FUDCon][5] to help move people over to GPG SmartCards. This is also going to be quite nice in that there will be a [GPG key signing event][6] after this hackfest.

### Come Prepared â€“ Equipment Required

It's important you come prepared! If you have ever had interest in this sort of thing, there's time to get equipment for the hackfest. Here's what you need:

  * SmartCard Reader, any will do. I recommend the [Gemalto USB Shell Token V2 from kernelconcepts.de][7].
  * An OpenPGP SmartCard. Several vendors have them. I recommend the [OpenPGP SmartCard V2 from kernelconcepts.de][8].

Both pieces are required. **Order ASAP,** it takes about 10 days to ship. Consider even shipping to the FUDCon hotel if you are concerned or late. I know Petra will work hard to deliver them as fast as possible.

### Doing a Little Prep Work

If you get your Token and SmartCard before FUDCon Lawrence and have a few spare minutes, feel free to read through my HOWTO. If you get through it, come to the hackfest and help others who might not have had time.

Cheers,
