  We're starting to really ramp up on the <a href="http://www.gooseproject.org/">GoOSe Project</a>. If you haven't heard about this project, check out my <a href="{{<siteurl>}}2011/09/26/building-rpms-and-twif-interview/">previous</a> <a href="{{<siteurl>}}2011/09/19/building-an-os-the-workflow/">posts</a>.

Well, I have been meaning to write this post every day this week, only to be bombarded with work or other projects getting in the way. However, I am currently sitting at the [Beans & Brews][1] [at 45 East 11400 South in Sandy, Utah][2] participating in the [very first GoOSe Sprint][3].

My goal today is very simple, get [skein][4] 2.0 out the door for testing. Most of contributors will be using skein to build the upstream packages necessary to make the distribution work, so I need to finish this work.

There are other tasks being performed today, including documentation, package building, automating tasks and finishing up the [new website][5].

If you have any interest in seeing how an enterprise quality distribution can be rebuilt using free software, we'd love to have you stop by #gooseproject on [irc.freenode.net][6]. The [GoOSe mailing list][7] is another great place to read about what we're doing.

Or if you like physical space, come on by the Beans & Brews today from 10am until 2pm. There should be at least a few of us working on something all day long. Just look for the nerds in the corner getting all excited while discussing phrases like 'build process' and 'skein grant' :P

**Update: We're going to be moving down to the Beans and Brews at 155 East 13800 South at approximately 12:45pm**

Cheers,

Herlo
