The GoOSe team has been working very hard to get a 6.0 gold release out the door, we are very close.

Just released today is the second Release Candidate (Beta-RC2) for GoOSe 6.0 – You can find it [here][1]. In addition to the DVD, netinstall and CD installation images, you will now find a Live Desktop ISO.

Please help us by downloading and using the ISO images. [File any bugs you find][2]. It's incredibly [easy to become a contributor][3]!! (If you are not a contributor yet, please [email bugs to the goose-linux mailing list][4].)

Cheers,

herlo
