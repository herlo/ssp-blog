Recently, my roommate Chris and I upgraded our torrent server. This torrent server gets quite a bit of use, and so we thought it would be useful to add some more ram to a server that really needed it. This brings me to my topic for today, TorrentFlux.

TorrentFlux is a feature rich, web based torrent client which allows multiple users to run their favorite torrents all at the same time. The major benefits of TorrentFlux over other torrent clients is the ability to access a simple web page from anywhere in the world and start downloading their favorite ISOs or other items they might need. When they return home that evening, they can then burn their copy of the latest Ubuntu or RedHat.

TorrentFlux is Open Source, has the GPL license attached to it and is located at <a title="http://www.torrentflux.com" target="_blank" href="http://www.torrentflux.com">http://www.torrentflux.com</a>. Just recently, version 2.1 was released. This version has some cool new features like queueing and thread management. Although its not as feature rich as Azureus or ÂµTorrent are, it does have some other cool functionality that help it keep pace with these popular torrent clients.

A short feature list includes:

  * Uses the latest of either Bittorrent or BitTornado command line clients in linux.
  * Works in both Windows and Linux
  * Multi-user application
  * Queue control

Anyway, I thought you might like to hear a little bit about this amazing software and possibly try it yourself.

Cheers,

Herlo
