Wish me luck. I've decided to take the plunge and upgrade to werewolf tonight. After reading <a href="http://spevack.livejournal.com/33314.html" target="_blank">Max Spevack's post</a> about how to upgrade to Fedora 8, this <a href="http://qa-rockstar.livejournal.com/5615.html" target="_blank">post</a> from Will Woods stating that Rawhide is now ready to go and of course the current code freeze for this Thursday's release, I think its time to upgrade.

In fact, I plan for <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/9" target="_blank">Fedora 9</a> to do this much earlier so I can help test the release. I post here and now to make sure that commit to helping the Fedora Project squash bugs for Fedora 9. I'll accomplish this by installing it at Test 1 and actually report bugs as I find them.

Wish me luck with this upgrade and my future endeavors. I think its a good cause and a great way to get further involved with the community.

Cheers,

Herlo
