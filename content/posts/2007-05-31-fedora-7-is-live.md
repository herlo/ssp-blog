As of 8 AM MDT, Fedora 7 is available!

There are several to choose from so choose wisely. This Fedora is one of the largest undertakings by the Fedora Project. Here are just a few things you'll get with Fedora 7:

  * CD Creation Tools – Build your own custom Fedora CD/DVD with its own rpms and cateogories
  * Live CD for both GNOME and KDE – Something cool to give away to somebody who has never tried Linux. Or use it for rescuing a machine.
  * KVM Virtualization – A new way to make multiple operating systems run on your box.
  * Tickless Kernel – Better power consumption for laptops.
  * Extended wireless functionality – My wireless card will work now, yea!!!

There are many more than what are listed here. Go out and get your Fedora 7 today. There are two ways you can get the release, one by internet:

<a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Distribution/Download" target="_blank">http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Distribution/Download</a> – Currently, down. Keep trying!
  
<a href="http://torrent.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">http://torrent.fedoraproject.org</a> – Currently working.<a href="http://torrent.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank"><br /> </a>

Or you can come to the release party tonight, where I'll be demonstrating (hopefully) many of these cool features. You can find that announcement:
