Folks, it's been a few crazy weeks for me recently. Tons and tons of activity in my life. All of which has been good, so very good!

## Wedding on Friday the Thirteenth

On May 13, Jennifer and I were wed at a wonderfully pretty chapel downtown in Salt Lake City. The Holy Cross Historic Chapel, inside the Salt Lake Regional Medical Center is very pretty. Although a bit hot in the chapel that day, it was a beautiful ceremony. I was very excited when Jennifer walked down the aisle. So beautiful! And when she said 'heck yes' to the question of marriage, I was very excited.

The reception was even more awesome and the best part of the whole day. All of our good friends and family came and enjoyed some of the most awesome food at the [Wild Rose in South Jordan][4]. If you have not been to this restaurant, I suggest you check it out. Awesome food, awesome environment and Ken Rose, the owner-chef extraordinaire went above and beyond on everything!

## The Honeymoon

On Sunday, May 16, we flew to Miami. As we left the Salt Lake airport, Jennifer was a bit misty-eyed as we left AJ behind. Monday, we boarded the Norwegian Sky and enjoyed a 4-day cruise to the Bahamas. This being the first cruise for Jennifer and I, it was a ton of fun, but definitely not the culture we were expecting. Again, amazing food and great sites every day.

On Tuesday, we spent a good day out and about on Grand Bahama Island. Snorkeling and a deserted island with lots of good drinks and new friends. I really enjoyed the conch demonstration and later on, conch fritters at a little bar at Port Lucaya. Almost missed the last bus, but such a fun time.

Overall, quite an enjoyable time.

## UTOS Project Day

Today was the [UTOS Project Day][5]. We've been planning on having a few more of these and today's was no different. Quite an excellent event for those who made it out. Tons of hacking, snacking and collaborating. I had to run out to my niece Tanja's 1st birthday part, which was excellent and tons of fun, for part of the day. Overall, lots of good geeking out was had today!

We're planning another Project Day for August 27. Make plans now to come out and hack. More details to come very soon!

## South East Linux Fest (SELF)

If you are going to [SELF][8] this year, or have heard about it just here, I recommend you all try to get out to this amazing event. It's a great weekend conference in Spartanburg, South Carolina, June 10-12.

Unfortunately, I was trying to work out attending this event, but will not be able to make it due to many reasons. I went to the first SELF, and am sad that I haven't been able to make it sense. It's on my list for 2012 again, so here's hoping.

## The Future

Well, as you might be able to see, plenty of good things have been happening. Wedding, Honeymoon, Project Day and more work than I can handle is coming right along.

Recently, I announced the Silver project, an easy-to-use development environment for web development. I've been busy improving and should be able to release v0.3 by the end of June. Several good bug fixes and new features should bring more and more functionality, making it easier to do QA and deploy to live environments using Silver.

In the near future, another project I've been working on will be announced. I'm hoping it will happen in the next month or two. It's the project that has been filling in the gaps while I wasn't busy with the wedding, honeymoon or working. I am very excited to announce this project soon, so keep an eye out in the next little while!

Cheers,

Herlo
