I've been looking forward to this weekend ever since Mel Chua suggested it back in mid-December.  A [Fedora Activity Day][1] to revamp how Fedora manages events, deals with events is something that definitely has been needed for some time.  I would say that the [Fedora Ambassadors][2] have been doing a bang-up job going from event-to-event talking about [Fedora][3], its values and sharing the SWAG and media they bring along.  But I fear that while they've been working toward something valuable, the system is really only tribal knowledge, with a little bit of documentation on our wiki.   The system we have, while it works okay for some, could really be useful if there were a fully documented, managed way of handling each event, whether it be a Fedora run event, like our FUDCons, or not.

It's clear that Mel has done some incredible work, getting a good number of people to Raleigh this weekend.  I'm looking forward to giving my input and listenting to others as we come up with better ways to handle such things as the [EventBox][4], recording and streaming different presentations, encouraging users to join Fedora and the overall professionalism we portray at each of our events.  There are so many things to get done this weekend, I'm looking forward to seeing what comes out the other side.

As for what I will be doing most of the time.  While I plan to help with the [initial brainstorming on FUDCon, external events, etc.][5], I really plan to spend most of my time focusing on improving the way that we record and stream our events.  These events can be as simple as a Local User Group (LUG) meeting to something bigger, like the [Southern California Linux Expo (SCaLE)][6], the [Ohio Linux Fest][7] or [Pycon][8], and of course, somewhere in there, is the Fedora FAD and [FUDCon][9].

Now mind you, I can see hundreds of other uses for this concept of recording and streaming.  Including live video podcasts, recording for redistribution, ad-hoc collaboration sessions, troubleshooting a problem with code and many, many more use cases.  However, I think I'm going to try to limit my use cases to those specifically around our events.  Things where we can easily set up our recording equipment and share it with those interested, whether in real-time, or making it available later on to the general public.

The software we plan on using to get the recording and streaming off the ground, is called [freeseer][10].  It's been put together by some folks who help organize and run FOSSLC.  Andrew and Thanh have been hacking hard lately, altering their code to move from the patent encumbered [ffmpeg][11], to the more open and free [gstreamer][12] library.  They've also been busy moving from a gui with a command line behind it, to using the python gstreamer bindings.  Much cleaner, much easier to manage and alter in real time.  I'm very excited to see how we can improve freeseer over this weekend.  I actually think we'll be able to do quite a bit with freeseer to improve external participation in Fedora.

Well, the pilot just announced that we'll be landing in Raleigh in about 20-30 minutes, and that I need to pack up my electronics.  I'm looking forward to seeing all of my Fedora friends and making an amazing events solution.  I'll try to keep you updated, with pictures and text, over the next few days.

Cheers,

Herlo
