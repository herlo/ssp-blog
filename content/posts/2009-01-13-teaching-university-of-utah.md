Starting tomorrow night, I will officially be the instructor for the LPI 103 course at the University of Utah.  This course uses the awesome [Guru Labs][1] courseware and teaches Network Administration and Security as well as Troubleshooting.  I'm excited to get back into the swing of teaching.

The course is 15 weeks long, 3 hours per night and will be held in the Warnock Engineering Building (WEB) room 208 on Wednesdays from 6-9pm.  Basically, that means I'll be teaching Linux once a week and keeping up my training skillz.

The only real drawback is that I'll be missing the PLUG and SLLUG meetings for the better part of four months.

Cheers,

Herlo
