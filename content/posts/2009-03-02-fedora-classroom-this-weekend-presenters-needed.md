Hi all,

It's me, your friendly neighborhood Fedoran asking all of you to consider giving an irc class this month in the [Fedora Classroom][1].Â  It doesn't matter how complex the presentation is, just that you can help share some knowledge about free software.

If you are interested in participating, [sign up today][1], and let myself (herlo) or Kevin (nirik) know in #fedora-classrom on irc.freenode.net.

Looking forward to seeing all the great presentations this weekend.

Cheers,

Herlo
