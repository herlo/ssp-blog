I believe it's a very common desire to improve your skillset as a tech geek.  I believe there are many people out there who just want to learn how to do a few things so they can get their job done.  I also believe that many people would like to make more money at their job, either as a System Administrator or to become a sysadmin.

### The question is, how do you gain the skills to become a better sysadmin?

In my opinion, one of the best ways to gain experience quickly, is to participate in training classes, such as the amazing classes run by [Red Hat][1].  But sometimes, those cost a ton of money, and the current company doesn't want to foot the bill.  Of course, you are trying to save your pennies to get to there, but that can take time.

However, there are cheaper alternatives.  I believe the community is the best way overall to gain this knowledge. While it takes a bit more time to get there, over time, you can learn a major portion of what it takes to become a skilled sysadmin.

#### Local User Groups

I suggest attending a Local User Group that specializes in Linux administration.  These groups take one topic per month and can educate you (usually) for free.  I really enjoy my LUGs and have gained tons of knowledge over the years.

#### Conference Events

Many conferences, like SCaLE, offer space to communities to run day long activities.  The [Fedora Activity Day at SCaLE][2] is a good example of where you can quickly gain skills as a system administrator for a very low cost.  If you are looking to improve your system administration skillset, I highly recommend attending the [FAD at SCaLE][2] this year.
