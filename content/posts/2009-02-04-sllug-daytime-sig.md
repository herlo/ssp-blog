So, I've done it.  I've scheduled a room at the Salt Lake Public Library for the 2nd Wednesday of each month.  The meetings will begin at 11:30 and go til about 1pm.  We have the room reserved from 9-1 each time we meet so feel free to come early and participate.  Feel free to bring your sack lunch or buy something from the vendors on the first floor (just make sure to clean up after yourself).

**Our first meeting will be next Wednesday, Feb 11 from 11:30am-1pm**
  
I will present _'Fedora Remix: Custom distributions based upon proven design'_

### Here's the rest of the details:

Conference room A on the lower level of the Salt Lake Library has been reserved.  Head down the stairs, make a left turn (essentially a U turn).  The conference room is directly under the foyer area (the area with all the shops on the 1st level)  If you aren't clear, ask the information desk.  A map is available [here][1] of all floor plans of the library.

Also, our meetings should be posted on the Electric Signs by the entrance to the library on the first floor.

### Meeting Days & Times:

All meetings will be held from 11:30am – 1pm on the Second Wednesday of each month.

  * Wednesday, February 11
  * Wednesday, March 11
  * Wednesday, April 8
  * Wednesday, May 13
  * Wednesday, June 10

Feel free to add this and other Utah Tech Events to your calendar by adding the ['Utah Tech Events' feed][2] to your calendar.

#### Traxx

You can get off 2 blocks west of the Library.  If you get off at the 'Courthouse 500 South' stop
  
There is also a University Train that stops right next to the library, but you'll have to transfer at Gallivan Center.

#### Parking

Parking is recommended to be one block away from the Library as they have reduced the meters in front of the Library to only 30 minutes.  However the meters directly east (on 200 East) should still be 2 hours.  Make sure to check the time you allow yourself is plenty.

See you all there.
