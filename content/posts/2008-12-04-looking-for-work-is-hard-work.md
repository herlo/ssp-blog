Recently, I was laid off from [Guru Labs.][1] While I still think of them as a great company, I must forge on, looking for a new job. I really appreciate the 2.5 years I worked and all the friendships I made.  I also enjoyed the work and it reinforced my desire to share my love of free software with the world.

While I am a pretty solid Linux Admin, what I really think I'd be good at, is Project Management.  The problem being that I've little to no paid experience for such a thing.  The reason, however, that I believe I'd be a good fit for something like this is the fact that I've been in charge of the [Utah Open Source Conference][2] and it's successful rise to the largest community conference in Utah.

Last year, we had a successful conference after a year of planning.  This year's conference was much less work thanks to all the great volunteers, but it was still a big success, and a lot of work.  I'm excited to say that **this** is my pride and joy, and why I think I would be a good fit for a Project Manager.

In addition, I'm looking into starting my own business, the only problem there is the timing.  I'd like to launch it soon, but I don't have enough capital to really get going anywhere.  However, I may still do this as I think the ideas I have would work well and could really benefit an open source community as well as small/medium sized tech businesses.  In fact, I have a meeting set up for tomorrow morning with someone who's believed in me from the beginning on this endeavor.  I'm excited to try my hand as an employer.

I do want to mention that while this isn't a plea to help get me a job, but rather some thoughts I needed to scribble down, I am actively looking for work.  If you have anything that might fit, here's the latest version of [my resume][3] (in pdf form).

Guess we'll see where the world takes me on this fun, fun ride I've been on for 30-some-odd years now.  And I guess that's the point, I'm really enjoying this ride called life and so while it's a bit of a stressful time, I'm grateful to accept these challenges.  I love solving problems, and this is just another small problem.
