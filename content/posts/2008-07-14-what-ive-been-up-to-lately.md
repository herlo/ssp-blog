Well, its been more than two weeks since my last post about FUDCon.  I figure its high time I posted something about what's been going on in my neck of the woods.  Things have been quite busy and are bound to continue at this phrenetic pace for a bit longer.

**DarkIce – Audio Streaming**

I've been working this past week on getting <a href="http://darkice.tyrell.hu/" target="_blank">darkice</a> packaged for Fedora.  Darkice is a front end audio recording tool for streaming servers like Icecast.  I much prefer it over ices and any other streaming client I've tried.  It does have bits for mp3/mp2/faac as well as ogg/vorbis, so I'll be packaging it for only the latter.

It seems rpmbuild is a bit more cryptic from my last foray into building RPMs and I have to hunt a little harder for the libs and the binaries.  Its coming along nicely, now that I have my virtual machine back in place.  I'm also hoping that darkice will be easy to integrate into Fedora Talk as I've never dealt with the asterisk end before.

**Utah Open Source Conference**

This past weekend, we spent a good bit of time reviewing and selecting <a href="http://2008.utosc.com/speaker/list/" target="_blank">presentations</a> for the Utah Open Source Conference.  I am the head organizer and founder of this **all volunteer** conference. In fact, our very own FPL, Paul Frields will be <a href="http://blog.utos.org/2008/07/12/announcing-a-utosc-keynote-speaker-paul-frields/" target="_blank">keynoting on Thursday</a> evening.  Keep an eye on this blog for future updates about the conference.

**A New Interest**

I've recently started to see someone of the female persuasion.  Many of my friends have met her, and I'm guessing they like her as I do (well, not quite as much).  Here's hoping things go well with Jennifer

There's more here, and I'll try to be more vocal about it as I think its good to share.

Cheers,

Herlo
