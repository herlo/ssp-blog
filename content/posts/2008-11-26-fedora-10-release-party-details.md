Recently, I announced a [Fedora 10 release party][1] here on my blog,  It turns out, that not only will it be a release party, with (hopefully) physical and electronic media available, but it will also be an **installfest**!!

_**SO BRING YOUR MACHINES AND GET THEM INSTALLED!**_

Victor Villa of the [Utah PHP User Group][2] (UPHPU) and a <a href="http://utos.org" target="_blank">Utah Open Source</a> Core Team Leader has offered his work as the location for the event.  It's large, easy to find and best of all, centrally located in Draper, Utah.

We'll have food, fun and probably even some prizes.  We're working out the minor details but come on down and enjoy an evening of reverie with your Fedora friends!
