**Presentation: Basics of Puppet
  
Presenter: Andrew Shafer
  
** 
  
Next Wednesday, May 13 is the next SLLUG Daytime SIG meeting.  We'll be getting a great presentation on Puppet from Andrew Shafer of Reductive Labs.  Andrew is a full-time Puppet developer and has been demonstrating the value of puppet for some time.  He lives here in Salt Lake and is excited to show the basics of Puppet.

What is Puppet?  (for the curious and uninitiated)

Puppet is an open-source next-generation server automation tool. It is composed of a declarative language for expressing system configuration, a client and server for distributing it, and a library for realizing the configuration.

More information is available here: <http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions>

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––-

We meet in conference room A on the lower level of the Salt Lake Library.  Head down the stairs, make a left turn.  The conference room  is directly under the foyer area (the area with all the shops on the 1st level)  If you aren't clear, ask the information desk.

Also, our meetings should be posted on the Electric Signs by the entrance to the library on the first floor.

Cheers,

Herlo
