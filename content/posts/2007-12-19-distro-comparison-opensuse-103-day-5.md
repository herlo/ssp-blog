I, unfortunately, can't live in an environment like openSUSE without my bluetooth mouse.  I struggled through for 5 days, but am now back on Fedora.

I really appreciate the opinions, comments and helpful guidance given and look forward to installing Ubuntu early next year and doing a similar, yet majorly biased, comparison to Fedora.

If nothing else, this project has taught me that openSUSE, with all of its faults, is quite a nice distribution.  Many features are very well done, others need some work, but in the end, its not the distribution for me.

I hope my experience has given at least some a view of nice features and improvements that have been made in openSUSE.  I look forward to testing openSUSE 11 when it comes out.

Cheers,

Herlo
