I've been very busy this last two weeks updating pages and working on finalizing details for UTOSC 2008, held August 28-30, 2008.  For instance, the Fedora booth is coming along nicely.  For a conference of around 400, we should have a pretty good booth turnout.  I had Jeffrey Tadlock, <a href="http://blog.utos.org/2008/07/12/announcing-a-utosc-keynote-speaker-paul-frields/" target="_blank">Paul Frields</a> (who's also keynoting btw) and its possible other NA Ambassadors may attend.  I'm really excited about this development.

In addition, <a href="http://blog.utos.org/2008/07/02/announcing-a-utosc-keynote-speaker-joe-brockmeier/" target="_blank">Joe Brockmeier</a> of OpenSUSE will also be keynoting and we've got quite a list of presenters on our website.  Our goal is to help open source grow in Utah, and by providing this conference once a year, we can help our local LUGs and open source leaders.  We have approximately 50 presentations, plus events and other fun stuff up our sleeve over this 3 day conference.

One of the great events returning this year is the <a href="http://gurulabs.com/training/" target="_blank">Guru Labs</a> Troubleshooting Challenge.  We hope to have this event bigger and better this year, with cash prizes for the winner(s).  There will be sign-ups available on Thursday morning at the registration booth and the contest will run all day Friday, crowning a winner Friday night!

Another great return from last year is <a href="http://www.knowledgeblue.com" target="_blank">KnowledgeBlue</a>.  With opensourceTV, they'll be recording the video for several of our presentations and keynotes.  They'll be working just like last year (only better) to provide interviews as well with some of the leaders of the open source community.  We expect you all will enjoy the videos as they go up on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/groups/utosf" target="_blank">youtube</a>.  This year, they will focus on multiple angles and getting a good quality presentation from the presenters.

Lastly, I'd like to talk a little bit about Family Day at UTOSC, August 30, 2008.  If you take a look at the presentations on Saturday, you'll notice a bit of a trend.  With a few exceptions, presentations are intended to help the family. Also, we are working on activities for the kiddies such as an OLPC, videos on MythTV, edubuntu, Fedora Electronics Lab demos and more in our try-it lab.  We're also working to acquire a moon bounce and sumo suits (for the big kids).  Saturday looks to be a ton of fun.

**NOTE**: This doesn't mean that we have enough family stuff, and in fact, we really don't.  One thing I'd like to see, is a presentation on content filtering for the family.  Something like &#8220;Howto use Dan's Guardian effectively&#8221; or a discussion of pfsense, smoothwall or other firewalling/filtering tools.  If you have a presentation you'd like to suggest in this area, please let me know by commenting or emailing me.

I hope to see many of you there as the cost is quite low at $70 and if you are LUG member, its only $35 until August 7 for the early bird pricing.  Read more on our website at <a href="http://2008.utosc.com/" target="_blank">http://2008.utosc.com</a> or register directly with eventbrite at <a href="http://utosc2008.eventbrite.com" target="_blank">http://utosc2008.eventbrite.com</a>.

See you all there.
