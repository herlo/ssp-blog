Following up with our <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors/Meetings/2008-09-09" target="_blank">FAMNA</a> meeting this week, the FAMNA regional ambassadors are meeting tomorrow night at 20:00 EDT in #fedora-ambassadors (irc.freenode.net) to discuss the agenda and events surrounding the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FAD/FADNA2008" target="_blank">Fedora Ambassador Day – North America</a>.  I'm not sure if this is the first FAD – NA, but we're definitely in a good resurgence with some good folks involved.

In commemoration of this exciting event, which will be held concurrently with the Ohio Linux Fest, October 10-12, I created a badge similar to the one created by Nicu Buculei for FAD EMEA.

I'm excited this looks as good as it does and will show pride for those Fedora Ambassadors in North America who will be joining us at OLF.

Cheers,

Herlo
