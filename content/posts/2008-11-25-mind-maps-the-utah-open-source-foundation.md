### The Utah Open Source Foundation &#8220;Mind Map&#8221;

After creating the [Fedora Project Mind Map][1], I was better able to understand how UTOS was currently structured.  I was able to put together the main pieces pretty quickly, although it seems there are several gaps in my thought process still.  For that reason, I'm opening the [UTOS structure][2] up as well.  It might not have as many contributors, but I'd like to see the structure grow.
