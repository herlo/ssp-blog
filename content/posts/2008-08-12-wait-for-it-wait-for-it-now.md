In the next 3 weeks, I will be among the busiest people I know.  Probably the only people busier are Presidential hopefuls, Olympic organizers and sadly, those fighting in Georgia.  The reason I am writing this post is to help me remember what I have left to complete between now and the <a href="http://2008.utosc.com/" target="_blank">Utah Open Source Conference 2008</a> on August 28-30, 2008.

Recently, I learned that our website doesn't render well in Internet Exploder, Safari and some older versions of Firefox.  I'm guessing its due to the inability I have to create and maintain css, because well, I'm not a design guy.  Because of this, we're having a hackfest tonight, both at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/herlomurray" target="_blank">my house</a>, and <a href="http://blog.utos.org/utos-how-to-irc/" target="_blank">online</a>.  Feel free to come by at 8:30 and help out.

Prior to the hackfest, I will be working with <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors" target="_blank">Fedora Ambassadors</a> to grow the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors/NA" target="_blank">North American</a> region.  We'll be discussing such things as AmbassadorKit, EventBox and of course, Fedora's presence at UTOSC 2008.  This meeting tends to get a lot of good people making the world a better place.  I am interested in making this happen starting with North America.  If you are interested in helping out, or just lurking, feel free to drop by #fedora-meeting on irc.freenode.net at 1:00UTC (9pm EDT).

Prior to the Fedora NA meeting, I'm planning on working on the PCs that we'll be using for the Utah Open Source Conference.  This will be done over at a friends house, who is loaning the PCs to UTOSC for the week of the conference.

I am attempting to record every presentation this year with either audio or video.  We have been rewarded again this year by having our friends over at <a href="http://www.knowledgeblue.com" target="_blank">KnowledgeBlue</a> come and video record much of the conference, but they don't have enough staff or equipment to simultaneously record 4-6 rooms.  So the plan went to me to setup recording devices in each room.

The plan is simple setup 6 PCs with Linux, install <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">audacity</a> and <a href="http://darkice.tyrell.hu/" target="_blank">darkice</a>.  This way we can stream the keynote audio live over our streaming server and also just record the audio from other presentations to be published at a later date.  I anticipate I'll be able to install and complete this task pretty quickly.

Well, its now 7:40am here at my desk in my house.  I still have head into the office today for a bit of work, so off I go.  Feel free to come by #utos anytime today and wish me luck (or help if you are so inclined) with anything you can suggest.  Hopefully, today won't be too long.
