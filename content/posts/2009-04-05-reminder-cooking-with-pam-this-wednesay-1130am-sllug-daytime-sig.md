Hi all, just sending out a reminder that the SLLUG Daytime SIG will be meeting this Wednesday @ 11:30am.  The presentation details are below:

**Cooking with PAM**

Thad Van Ry will cover the basics of Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). If you're a Sys Admin who wants to know how PAM can help you or hurt you, this meeting is for you. Thad will go over the different stacks available as well as how to call modules and their control flags.

Thad is a Linux System Administrator for the LDS Church. He has been using Linux in his work life for the past 12+ years.

<!--more-->We meet in conference room A on the lower level of the Salt Lake Library.  Head down the stairs, make a left turn.  The conference room is directly under the foyer area (the area with all the shops on the 1st level)  If you aren't clear, ask the information desk.  A 

[map][1] is available of all floor plans of the library.

Also, our meetings should be posted on the Electric Signs by the entrance to the library on the first floor.
