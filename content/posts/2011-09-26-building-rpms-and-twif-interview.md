Many of you may have already heard from my good friend [Derek Carter about the GoOSe Project][1]. If you haven't, I'd love to hear your comments on what we are doing. I'd also encourage many of you to come and join the project and help us to build a community of contributors dedicated to making the best enterprise Linux rebuild available.

Recently, [Jonathan Nadaeu and I sat down and discussed Fedora, GoOSe and a few other fun things][2] on [This Week in Fedora][3]. The majority of the interview was about the [GoOSe project][4] and it covers a good bit of why we're doing what we're doing, how it works and how to get involved. Have a listen, and come hang out and help out the project!

In addition, I was asked to do a presentation this week on how to build RPMs at the [Ogden Area Linux User Group (OALUG)][5]. While I teach this in my day job as a Red Hat Trainer, I've never given my own presentation. I'm really excited to share some very useful tips and tricks on how to build an RPMs and set them up in a custom repository for your company or for others to consume. It's very cool and very easy to do most of this work.

So come on up to OALUG tomorrow night if you can.Â  I'll make sure to follow-up here with the useful links for those interested.

Cheers,

Herlo
