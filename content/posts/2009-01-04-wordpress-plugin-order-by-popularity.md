Ever wanted to have a blog ordered by the number of visits, comments, and such?  It would seem to me that this might be useful.  So I wrote a plugin to accommodate just that.

To be honest, I really shouldn't take that much credit for it, since Alex King wrote most of the functionality for [determining popularity][1] as his plugin **is required** for mine to work.  All I really did, was stand upon his giantness and make it so people could sort their blogs by popularity.

Feel free to [Download It][2]

Cheers,

Herlo
