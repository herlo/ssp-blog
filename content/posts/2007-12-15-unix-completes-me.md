Okay, okay.  I'm taking a quick break from my SUSE comparisons (and I will reply to all the comments I've been getting as well, keep them coming, its great) to entertain you all with this lovely picture my friend <a href="http://pthree.org" target="_blank">Aaron Toponce</a> just sent me.  I laughed out loud when I read it and knew it had to be posted online ASAP.

Sorry Aaron if I am stealing your thunder&#8230;.
