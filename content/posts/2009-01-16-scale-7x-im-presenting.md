Recently, I was informed that my presentation was approved for the [7th Southern California Linux Expo][1] (or SCaLE 7x).  I'm very excited to be presenting a topic I think will be not only fun, but valuable to many a Linux fan.  I will say that this is my first foray into the conference circuit as a presenter, but being an instructor for the past 5+ years, I'll have some fun stuff ot share.

The topic I submitted, Fedora Remix.

It turns out that it's a remix of another presentation from the [Utah Open Source Conference][2] by [Paul Frields][3].  But things have changed since that presentation was given. Here's a couple I'll mention:

  * First, Fedora has now approved a secondary trademark called '[Fedora Remix'][4].    I'll talk a little about how this can be used and what the benefit is to downstream groups and Fedora.
  * The [spin-kickstarts][5] rpm created by Jeroen van Meeuwen provides over 30 kickstarts you can start with to make things better.

In preparation for this presentation at SCaLE 7x, and if you are in Utah, I'll be presenting it (hopefully) a couple times at the Local User Groups (LUGs).

Cheers,

Herlo
