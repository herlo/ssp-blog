So tomorrow is Software Freedom Day.  And because I've been a big slacker this year, I didn't get the time to set up an event as I had hoped.  However, because others in our community are awesome and didn't want to see this day go completely to the Microsofties and non-free software folks, there's going to be a Linux InstallFest at [Utah Code Camp][1] at Neumont University.

Now, I'll be there from around 9am to about 1pm, so it might be good to come and hang out.  I'll be dropping some [Fedora][2] DVDs and CDs by (which I need more Live Media already gah!) so people can pick them up and try out the coolest operating system in the world!

At about 3pm, I'm headed over to a friends house for boardgames.  We're going to play '[Arkham Horror'][3], based on H.P. Lovecraft's [Cthulhu Mythos][4], which should be fun as I have never played it before.  Both jennifer and I are attending with some friends I've had for a short while now.  Should be a blast.

If it is really good, I'll suggest playing it at the [Boardgame Bash][5] at [UTOSC 2009][6] (you knew I couldn't resist putting in a plug for the conference, did you?!)

Lastly, I'll be settling in for the evening probably recovering from the hard week around 10 or 11 catch up on sleep and prep for golfing with my brothers on Sunday.

It'll be a very nice weekend I think, looking forward to the excitement and relaxation.  I'm very excited to be semi-busy, but doing what I love.  I sure hope it turns out as well as I anticipate.

Cheers,

Herlo
