I arrived in Raleigh today for <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon/FUDConF9" target="_blank">FUDCon.</a>

What? A little early, you say? Sure is, but I thought I'd get an entire week's head start and help out the crew with preparations.

Okay&#8230; That's not really true, but I am in Raleigh already. Because of my employment at <a href="http://www.gurulabs.com" target="_blank">Guru Labs</a>, I asked if I could fly into Raleigh after my classes on Friday. Instead, Dax, my boss made the deal even sweeter. He sent me to Raleigh to teach two <a href="http://www.redhat.com/training" target="_blank">Red Hat</a> classes at <a href="http://www.redhat.com" target="_blank">Red Hat</a>! Because of this, I'm currently teaching a RH133 this week, and a RH300 next week downstairs at the Red Hat home office.

On Thursday, my good friend <a href="http://www.jaredsmith.net" target="_blank">Jared Smith</a>, of Asterisk fame (and a good boardgame buddy) will be arriving just prior to FUDCon. I'm guessing he'll be there to help <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/9/FeatureList" target="_blank">F9</a> do more with Asterisk. Maybe we'll have time for a quick game of Settlers or something, if he brings it â€“ hint, hint Jared.

Over the weekend, I'll be hacking away (or maybe just testing the eeepc) on the F9 release with the likes of [Max Spevack][1] and [Greg De Koenigsberg][2]. And since I'm already on Red Hat's campus, I'm prepping my trip by making sure I know where all of the locations are for the events.

So, if you are at Red Hat this week and want to burn some time, come on by and say hi to me and my class. We'll be learning about installation, filesystems, RAID and LVM, and much, much more.

I'm so stoked for this weekend! Its going to be an awesome FUDCon. Hopefully, I'll be able to convince the boss to send me to the next FUDCon as well.

Cheers,

Herlo
