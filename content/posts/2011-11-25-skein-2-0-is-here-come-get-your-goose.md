  If you have ever wanted to help build your own Linux <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=linux+enterprise+rebuild">enterprise rebuild</a>, come join the <a href="http://gooseproject.org">GoOSe Project</a> and get involved!

Today and tomorrow we're sprinting. We also have a sprint scheduled for next week!

Why you ask? Well, I finally have had enough time to finish coding skein and it's ready for release to 2.0. There are most definitely some bugs and other things that need to be completed (read: documentation), but it's functional and is ready to get us to the end of our first rebuild phase.

We have a ways to go, and a goal of EOY 2011 for our first Alpha!

Come join us at #gooseproject on [irc.freenode.net][1] and get started today! More information is available at <http://gooseproject.org>

Cheers,

Herlo
