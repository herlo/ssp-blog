Let me get this out first, I'm a avid fan of all things Mozilla. Even with the limitations they cause, the problems I've heard about Firefox and Thunderbird and all that Jazz, I'm still a big fan, current and future consumer of these wonderful applications.

BUT!

Why is it that a bug that has been logged for some time can go so long without being fixed. It sure seems like a very simple fix, but no, its still broken.

What, you ask, am I talking about? Well, its this <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=375292" target="_blank">bug</a> on mozilla's bugzilla that's bugging me. While its not a **major** bug, its annoying and causes me heartache every time I look into my _/tmp_ directory.

The problem is that as **Thunderbird** creates and moves data around when using a filter rule. It creates temporary files which is all fine and good, but the problem is the code is broken that removes the temporary files. My _/tmp_ directory just fills and fills with these useless little files. It's driving me insane. Every time I go into the directory to look at something, I'm bombarded with files that are named `Let me get this out first, I'm a avid fan of all things Mozilla.

Have a look into the directory:

Why do we need to have 492 files in there? I don't even have 492 messages I read each day. Come on Mozilla Foundation, take a few minutes and fix this **annoying** little bug that's been hanging around since this March!
