Yes, that's right folks. I'm looking for a new image to adorn the top of my blog. I've got this pretty new theme (not shown on my site yet) but it needs a fresh new coat of penguin love.

So I thought I'd share with the community and see if anyone could come up with a new image for my blog. The general idea is it has to go with my blog title &#8220;Sexy Sexy Penguins&#8221;. I'm imagining a few &#8220;very attractive&#8221; penguins or something related in that way. To help generate some interest in helping me with my sexy penguins search, I might offer a bit of a reward, say $50 to the winner.

To help you in your search, I'm planning on using this <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3x3bcy" title="Pop Blue Theme" target="_blank">theme</a>. There could be slight adjustments, but the image should be in several desirable formats, including banner, screensaver, and a any others that might seem useful. The main reason I am doing this is to motivate myself into blogging more, both for your benefit, but also for mine.

Fedora-Tutorials needs a face lift, help the Sexy Sexy Penguin(s) come to life! Thank you all for enjoying my posts, I plan on providing much more in the near future.

Cheers,

Herlo
