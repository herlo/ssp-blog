There is a great opportunity upon us to show Utah what Open Source can do.  Come on and join the rest of Utah Open Source.  Not only attend the Utah Open Source Conference, but submit a presentation or tutorial.

Here's an excerpt from a post over at the Utah Open Source Conference website.  ([http://www.utosc.org][1])

You have just two weeks left to get your papers in for the Utah Open Source Conference. The deadline for paper submissions is **May 15, 2007**.

The Utah Open Source Conference is September 6-8, 2007 and we need presenters and volunteers.

  To submit papers for this conference please send an outline to <a href="mailto:participate@utos.org">participate@utos.org</a>.

  I'll be there and will be presenting.  Will you?
