So I am sitting in my hotel in Los Angeles, preparing to head back to Utah, its 2:37am PDT and I have been meaning to post the rest of my experience at FUDCon.  First off, I'd like to thank Mo and Ray for letting me stay at their home with them.  They were great hosts!  I'd also like to re-thank Max and Paul and the FedoraProject for sponsoring me out to Boston on such short notice.  I still feel grateful to be part of such a great community!

FUDCon F10, for me, was a time of realization.  Understanding what it is to get involved in projects that scratch that itch.  For providing services toward something I'm good at, into a larger community who could really take advantage of that service.  And while I am still feeling my way through the Fedora world, I think a few things are clearer now after reflecting on this last FUDCon.

**I want to record and stream audio and video.** 

I'm thinking that along with the Fedora Talk project, I could configure and use tools to provide a non-interactive streaming server for certain events/presentations.  What I am thinking of here is things like FUDCon keynotes and sessions.  In fact, I plan to purchase a higher quality microphone / mixer combo to better record the audio at the source.

Video and screencasting in real-time seems a bit more of a challenge.  Putting that together with the streaming audio seems like a fun project and scratches several itches I've been experiencing lately.

**I need to learn how build better RPMs**

Spot taught a great session at FUDCon F9 in Raleigh about RPM packaging, and Rex Deiter talked this time about becoming a package maintainer.  I've got a few packages that I'd like to get into the fedora tree, and I think by the end of this year, that can happen.  I'm okay at packaging, but haven't ever submitted a spec file to spot.  While I'm nervous about how ugly the first package will look, I'm also excited at the prospect of learning better and more efficient ways of building useful tools for the masses.

**I think everyone should build their own spin of Fedora**

After the 5+ hour session on Friday's hackfest regarding the spins website and what the spins SIG has already accomplished, I've taken some initiative and started to create content to help the prospective spin enthusiast.  I'm a big fan of the Eee PC and am looking forward to purchasing the 901 in the winter.  Until then, I'm planning on helping improve the spin process so we don't fail to release spins again.  The custom and official spins 'built with Fedora' can be so much more prolific if we just provide the right tools to build a spin.  It really should be nothing more than, here's my kickstart, build me an iso.  This would of course have to follow the general standards for acceptable software.

**The relationships (FUDBuddies) made at FUDCon are up my alley**

I met Rex Dieter, Mo Duffy, Ray Strode, Dennis Gilmore and Ian Weller this time.  We had great conversations about the world and of course Fedora.  I also got to talk more to Toshio, Greg and J5 who I had met previously at FUDCon F9.  I indeed learned a bunch from Toshio about TurboGears too.  Its something I'll treasure for releases to come.

To end this post, I've got some audio of the <a href="http://herlo.fedorapeople.org/files/fudcon-olpc-final.ogg" target="_self">olpc session</a> and <a href="http://herlo.fedorapeople.org/files/fudconf10paulfrields.ogg" target="_self">paul's keynote</a>, as well as some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/fudcon/" target="_blank">photos</a> I've posted around the interweb, enjoy.  Paul's keynote will also be up on our new <a href="https://www.miroguide.com/channels/6891" target="_blank">FedoraTV Miro channel</a>, check it out!

Cheers,

Clint
