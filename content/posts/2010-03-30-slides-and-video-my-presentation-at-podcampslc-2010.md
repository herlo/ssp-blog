Last Friday was [PodCampSLC 2010][1] at Neumont University, put on by my good friend Mr. [Thom Allen][2].  He did a bang up job as usual, it was a great event.

I spent the morning at PodCampSLC 2010, including my presentation at 10am entitled ['Capturing audio and video on the cheap' or 'How to keep the wife happy while buying lots of electronic equipment'][3].  I've been tinkering with audio and video recording equipment for several years now as part of the [Utah Open Source Foundation][4] and the [Utah Open Source Conference][5] and figured I had a lot to share.

My presentation slides were pretty basic, but cover some of the equipment I have purchased on the cheap.  In addition, we recorded the presentation using [FreeSeeR][6], a free software application for  recording the desktop screen, external video and/or audio.

Enjoy the [presentation slides][7] and [video][8] as I really enjoyed presenting and am looking forward to PodCampSLC 2011!

Cheers,

Herlo
