After only three days of waiting, and it passing through Hong Kong, Alaska and Louisville to Utah, my T60p is here.

I started playing with it last night, its been so much fun.  Here's a couple things I've enjoyed so far&#8230;.

ThinkVantage Recovery Diskettes – 7 total just in case I wanna restore that ol' winders xp I got with it&#8230;

Bluetooth – Connected it to my Palm, it's so beautiful!!

There is so much more I plan to do with it, including installing [XEN][1] and several OSes to go with it.

Updates will abound.
