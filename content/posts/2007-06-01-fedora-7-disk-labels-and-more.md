I've been curious lately as to how I could print labels for my Fedora 7 DVDs.  Because I am officially a Fedora Ambassador for Utah, I would like to give out nice looking DVDs with labels on them.  Well, I found a very nice lady who's put up eps versions of such labels and I plan to take them and print a few for myself and for those I give the DVDs/CDs.  Here's the link:

Enjoy these labels and send me pictures of your DVD happiness.

Cheers,
