Obviously, my distro is Fedora, but for those of you who might choose something else, let's play along.

This meme comes from <a title="1st thing to do after installing Fedora" href="http://kernelreloaded.blog385.com/index.php/archives/1st-thing-to-do-after-installing-fedora/" target="_blank">Valent Turkovic's blog post a few days ago</a>, so I thought I'd share mine.

`$ su -c 'yum install nautilus-open-terminal'`

This enables me to right click on the desktop and click 'Open in Terminal'. This is much better than choosing 'Applications -> System Tools -> Terminal', which in my opinion is a big pain in the ass!

While it used to open in the user's home directory, now it opens in their Desktop.Â  Not sure of the benefit for that, but I'm glad it's still around.

Cheers,

Herlo
