Lovely flight in First Class with Delta.  There was a bit of weather in Atlanta so we ended up looping around for about 30 extra minutes.  Not too bad, really.  Got the car (thanks SELF organizers for picking up that tab) and drove up to Clemson, was very very long drive!  Had to stop for food and caffeine about half way since it was nearly 1am at this point.

Working on my Fedora Remix presentation now, adding a few minor adjustments that should be fun.  Including letting people pick packages from the audience, should be pretty entertaining.

Slides are available [online][1].

Cheers,

Herlo
