As part of my effort to help out folks coming in for the Utah Open Source Conference 2009, we have filled up our household with out-of-towners. However, when I asked my awesome sweetie , Jennifer, about food, she had this reply:

21:37 <herlo> did you say you were willing to cook breakfast for us during UTOSC ??
  
21:37 <herlo> :-P
  
21:37 <herlo> I couldn't remember if you agreed, or balked
  
21:37 <Jennifer> I did. I will make sure I don't work so I can do it properly.
  
21:37 <Jennifer> 5 people, right. Plus us, of course.
  
21:38 <Jennifer> ?
  
21:38 <herlo> yeah
  
21:38 <Jennifer> Yep, for 3 days? I can do that. :)
  
21:38 <herlo> so far, I have Ian, Scott, Larry and Mirano and possibly Scott (from LA)
  
21:39 <herlo> it does mean that it has to be ready kind of early though&#8230;
  
21:40 <JenniferDean> Yep
  
21:40 <herlo> kk, grerat!
  
21:40 <herlo> or just great!
  
21:40 <JenniferDean> That's what prep the night before is for
  
21:40 <herlo> lol, yeah
  
21:41 <JenniferDean> The only rule is: stay out while I'm cooking. Lol

So as you can see, I just **had** to comment about it right now!  Jennifer is awesome!

Looks like our guests will be well taken care of during [UTOSC 2009][1]!!

See you all there! October 8-10, 2009.  [Register today!][2]

Cheers,

Herlo
