As I usually do while teaching class, I installed a Fedora 8 machine, and ran yum update.  Today I noticed a strange amount of time for one particular download:

While this is hilarious, its shouldn't happen.  Any ideas?  I know it didn't take 28927 seconds (or about 1/3 of a day) to download that foomatic package.

Cheers,

Herlo
