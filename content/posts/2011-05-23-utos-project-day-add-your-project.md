UTOS Project Day is this Saturday, May 28! If you are planning on attending and have a project that needs help or you just want to tell people about it, add it to the [UTOS Project Day 'Projects'][1] page. _Make sure you get it up early so folks who might be interested in your project can learn as much as possible before they attend **UTOS Project Day**._

Come on down this **Saturday, May 28** and hang out with other geeks. We'll provide you space to hack, snacks, lunch and plenty of projects to come and learn!

_Date: May 28_
  
 _Time: 12pm to 5pm_
  
 _Where: Open Source Technology Center @ Novell ([map][2])_

More information available on the [UTOS Project Day][3] website and the [UTOS Blog][4]. _UTOS is looking for operational volunteers. Stop by between_ _9-11am_ _and volunteer to help out!_

**Always free admission, free software and free food.**

We'll see you all there!

Cheers,

Herlo
