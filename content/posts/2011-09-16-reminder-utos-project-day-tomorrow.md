Boys and Girls, pay attention here!

If you have never been to a [UTOS Project Day][1], you just might want to attend. There have been 3 previously successful Project Day events and this one looks to be as awesome! In fact, just for attending and working on your project, there will be a raffle for a Motorola XOOM!

### But really, that's not why you should attend.

I will be there! :)

Oh, that's not enough? Here are 5 **excellent** reasons to attend!

  1. It's [Software Freedom Day][2] and what better way to come down and work on a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) project
  2. There will be a bunch of other folks there too, working on [interesting projects][3]
  3. Many will be willing to collaborate with you and discuss your project
  4. Free food and snacks throughout the day
  5. Helping out the [Utah Open Source Foundation][4] with its efforts for UTOSC 2012 next spring

### Add your project

If you would like help with your project, it's a good idea to [add it to the list][5]. If you are looking for a project, [check out the entries][3] and see if there is something there that interests you. Either way, there will likely be more projects than what is currently listed.

### So come on down!

<address>
  Miller Professional Development Center Room #226
</address>

<address>
  9750 South 300 West (<a href="http://snipurl.com/utos-miller-campus">map</a>)
</address>

<address>
  Sandy, Utah 84070
</address>

<address>
  10:00 am â€“ 5:30 pm
</address>

I know quite a few folks who will be interested in staying later as well at a local coffee shop or similar and hacking well into the evening. Don't let the draw of a [football game][6] get you distracted, there will be plenty of time to watch it on DVR on Sunday afternoon!

Cheers,

Herlo
