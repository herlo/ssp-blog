Hi all,

While at work today, setting up test environments for Ubuntu Gutsy (7.10), I needed to check something with the ubuntu.com DNS entries. So I ran the following:

`# dig -t ns ubuntu.com`

And got something very interesting and entertaining. Can you see what it was? Yes, the **mythic-beasts** are definitely alive and well within Ubuntu! Now that you are having fun, try these commands immediately afterward:

`# dig -t ns mythic-beasts.com`

And

`# whois mythic-beasts.com`

Note the other nameservers. Quite an entertaining 5-10 minutes of your life.

Enjoy,

Herlo
