Just so you are aware, we are holding the SLLUG Daytime Meeting this month.

As usual, come from 11:30am-1pm at BetaLoftSLC (357 W 200 S #201)  – <a href="http://betaloftslc.com/" target="_blank">http://betaloftslc.com</a>

This month, I thought I would share a basic git introduction.  In my opinion, the best Source Control Management (SCM) system out right now.  I've been using it for nigh on a year and I have converted a few systems over to it from svn.  This is more of a work session than a presentation, so come on down and learn how to use git.  It is recommended that you bring your laptops with you as that will benefit more if you do.

### Some suggested topics I can cover:

  * Local and remote git repositories (different workflows and other fun stuff)
  * Using git-svn to 'convert' from svn
  * Comparing Distributed Revision Control with Traditional (non-distributed) Revision Control
  * Git hooks, why they are valuable and when to use them
  * Other basic git discussions

See you all there.

Cheers,

Herlo
