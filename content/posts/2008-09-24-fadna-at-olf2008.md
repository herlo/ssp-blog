Get your name on the list for the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FAD/FADNA2008" target="_blank">Fedora Ambassador Day – North America</a>, October 10-12, 2008.  It's coming in just 2-1/2 weeks in Columbus, Ohio while we're enjoying the <a href="http://ohiolinux.org" target="_blank">Ohio LinuxFest</a>.  The agenda is being formed, we're planning a FADPub (maybe), and might even have some FAD – NA shirts to give away.

If you are coming to FADNA, please take a moment and sign up on the wiki page.  OLF doesn't have any more rooms at the Drury, where some Ambassadors are staying, so many of us are staying a short while out of town at the Holiday Inn Express in Grove City.  If you haven't reserved a room, they have pretty good rates, even cheaper than the Drury.

In addition, if you haven't taken a moment to <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedoraEvents/OhioLinuxFest/OhioLinuxFest2008" target="_blank">sign up to help at the Fedora booth</a>, we would like to make a good impression there as well.

Many of us will be carpooling in each day and we're working to reserve a room at the Holiday Inn Express for Sunday's Meeting.

See you all at FADNA.  I am very excited to meet many of the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors/NA" target="_blank">North American Ambassadors</a> at OLF.

Cheers,

Herlo
