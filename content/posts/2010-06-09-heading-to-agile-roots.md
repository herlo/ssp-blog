Agile infrastructure and management has been in my purview for some time now.  While I've never attended the [Velocity conference put on by O'Reilly][1] every year, I have been a regular attendee to [VeloSLC][2] in months past.

One of the coolest things to attend has arrived here in Salt Lake City.  That's [Agile Roots][3] next Monday and Tuesday!  I'll be going this year and am very excited to see [presentations][4] that will likely [enlighten][5] and [excite][6] me to do more with Agile.

I look forward to seeing you all there.
