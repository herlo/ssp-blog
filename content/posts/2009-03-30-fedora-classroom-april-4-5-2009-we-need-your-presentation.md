Well, it's that time of the month again, this coming weekend April 4 & 5 will be the sessions for the [Fedora Classroom][1]. This [month's sessions][2] are perfect for those in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

### Give a Presentation

If you are interested in helping us out with a presentation on anything related to [Fedora][3] or Free Software, we'd love to see it in the [Fedora Classroom][1] this weekend.  If you are not familiar with the MediaWiki syntax, just add a note on the [wiki page][1] or contact [Kevin Fenzi][4] (nirik) or [me][5] (herlo).

### New MC

In addition, we have a new Master of Ceremonies for this session.  Max Spevack will head this up and help keep things on time.  We'd like to thank him for performing this vital service.

### More Volunteers Needed

  * If you are interested in helping out with the IRC logs
  * We need **you** help us to spread the word about upcoming [Fedora Classroom][1] events. 
      * Blog about it
      * Tell your friends
      * Invite someone to teach a class

If you can help or know someone who can help, feel free to contact either [Kevin Fenzi][4] (nirik) or [me][5] (herlo) and we'll give you the low down.

Cheers,

Herlo
