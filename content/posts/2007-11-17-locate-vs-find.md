Tonight at the <a href="http://utah.ubuntu-us.org/" target="_blank">Ubuntu Utah User Group</a> I presented about Locate vs Find.

The slides are <a href="http://www.utosf.org/presents/FindvLocate.html" target="_blank">here</a> and written in <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/" target="_blank">S5</a>.

<a href="http://kubasik.net/blog/" target="_blank">Kevin Kubasik</a> also presented on <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2aecal" target="_blank">Desktop Search in Gnome</a>. It was pretty cool as well.

The presentations went very well and was streamed and recorded by <a href="http://utosf.org" target="_blank">Utah Open Source Foundation</a>.
