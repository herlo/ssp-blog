Recently, I've been quite busy working at my new job at the [Linux Foundation][1]. I've really been enjoying it and am excited to be working there.

One of the perks I've been able to work out will be to attend the [Fedora Activity Day][2] this week in Raleigh, where we'll be working on [two-factor authentication][3] among other things. This has been something I've recently set up at LF and am hopefully going to be involved in getting this working for Fedora as well.

Additionally, I have been working on getting a [GPG SmartCard token working to accommodate ssh authentication][4]. I think Fedora is going to be using Yubikeys, but I thought it might be cool to show this off as an alternative.

Anyway, it should be a fun week and very busy as well. Watch for more reports here about our progress.

Cheers,

Herlo
