It's been a little while since I posted on this blog, but I really need to get back into the habit again.

The reason I'm posting is that I have been accepted as a speaker for [Ignite Salt Lake 3][1] at the Murray Theatre on August 20.

I've thinking about my presentation and I think I've got a good idea for what I am going to do, but I am just fleshing out my ideas here.

My talk is entitled: _Utah Open Source – Free Software Abounds_

I plan talking about the basic concept of free software, the culture and how we do open source in Utah.  I intend to close out the presentation showing off the Utah Open Source Conference and it's benefit to the community.

I'm planning on having some real fun at Ignite Salt Lake.  I sure hope you all will come and join me on August 20 at the Murray Theatre.

Cheers,

Herlo
