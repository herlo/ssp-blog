So I've done it.

Yes, I really have done it this time!

**Well, maybe&#8230;**time will tell.

I've gone and posted an idea for a project on the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SummerCoding/2008/Ideas#head-840acbe959ff6d0b1ba2e5e6901cc92da75c6090" title="Fedora Webinstall" target="_blank">Fedora wiki page</a> for the Google Summer of Code (GSoC), but that's not all, no!

In addition, I took the time to apply to be a mentor at the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/mentor_home.html" target="_blank">Google Summer of Code Project</a> page.  And what's weirder, is I hope I get the opportunity to make this idea a reality, because I think its something that Fedora could really use.

I'm somewhat surprised it hasn't already been created. A couple of people found this idea too, and have emailed me about it, and I need to reply.  Soon that will happen.

I am really excited.

Cheers,

Herlo
