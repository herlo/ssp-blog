One of the coolest new things coming out for Fedora 8, the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/OnlineDesktop" target="_blank">Gnome Online Desktop</a>! Its an amazing device, provides a simple interface for working with the new web world in which we live.

It reminds me a bit of spotlight for Mac, but this thing has much more. With all of the web integration it has, including google docs, calendar, last.fm, digg and more, you can't pass up the opportunity to try out this amazing desktop.

I've attached an ogg/vorbis screencast of some of my interaction with it in Fedora 8 Test 3. Although it claims to be **just** a demo, it sure looks good!

Cheers,
