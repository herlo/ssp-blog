Tonight is the very first time I have ever been to the Utah PHP User's Group meeting, and I am really excited.

The topic seems really cool; PHP, AJAX and Eclipse. I have never used Eclipse before so that will be cool, as I have heard its a cool tool.

One of the guys from the group wanted to go, but his car apparently broke down this last week, so I am giving him a ride and hopefully we will have a good chat on the way.

I am way excited.

Cheers,

Herlo
