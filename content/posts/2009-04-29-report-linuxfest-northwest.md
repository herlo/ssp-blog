This past weekend, I spent some time at [LinuxFest NorthWest][1]. It was quite fun and entertaining, probably the most relaxing conference I've ever attended.  Interestingly enough, I didn't rent a car, which is unusual for me.  This is because I ran into the unmistakeable [Joe 'Zonker' Brockmeier][2], who offered me a ride to the event.  This was probably the most convenient way to get to the conference.  We spent quite a bit of time talking (well, mostly me talking) about cool stuff.  Joe is quite a personable guy and I've really come to like and respect him.

This was the first time I was able to meet [Jon 'Maddog' Hall][3].  I was quite impressed by the stories he told in his presentation and at the after party. Maddog is an amazing character, funny, charismatic and very forward.  I really like his attitude about Free Software and am looking forward to chatting with him again.  I'm thinking that it'd be cool to get him out to Utah in October for [UTOSC 2009][4].

The LFNW organizers are amazingly friendly and nice.  They invited us to a barbeque after the conference to unwind and enjoy their home. They purchased some salmon right off the boat that day, it was amazing.  Along with the drinks and friends, I was in heaven.  I am really grateful to my good friend, [Karsten Wade][5], for being willing to spend a bit of time there, even on his daughter's birthday (he had spent much of the day in Seattle with her previously, but still).

I met [Adam Williamson][6], Jeff Sandys and [Scott Dowdle][7] who were all doing their part to help Fedora.  In addition, I got to spend a bit of time talking with [Jesse Keating][8] about a new messaging component for Fedora's infrastructure (which he also presented at LFNW).  Oh, and did I mention the blackberry cobbler on Saturday for lunch?  You haven't lived until you've had this blackberry cobbler put together by the culinary folks at the [Bellingham Technical College][9].

With that, I suggest that next year, anyone and everyone should attend LFNW and enjoy the pictures (below).  On Friday, I'll upload a few more since I'm limited to 100MB/month on my flickr account.
