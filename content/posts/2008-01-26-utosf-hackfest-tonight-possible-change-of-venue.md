Well, it appears that I am one of the many victims of Qwest and their _lurid_ line noise issues, thus no DSL for me! Because of this, I'm in the process of scrambling for a new location for our <a href="http://www.utos.org/2008/01/17/utosf-hacking-night/" target="_blank">UTOSF HackNight</a> this evening. If anyone who's coming would like to donate their location, or know of some place central to those in Salt Lake County with free wireless and open all night, let me know. I accept emails at herlo1@gmail or you can twitter me at <a href="http://twitter.com/herlo" target="_blank">http://twitter.com/herlo</a>.

If nothing pans out, fear not, I do have a possible alternate location for this event, which I should be able to arrange for by the end of the day as a backup plan. As it stands now, everyone should just arrive at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/29v5dn" target="_blank">my place</a> **@6:30** (instead of 7pm) in Murray and we'll carpool and caravan as desired.

See you all tonight for an awesome hackfest!

Cheers,

Herlo
