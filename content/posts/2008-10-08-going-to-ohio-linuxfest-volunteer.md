In last night's FAmNA meeting, we discussed the fact that nobody had remembered to <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedoraEvents/OhioLinuxFest/OhioLinuxFest2008#Booth_Schedule" target="_blank">register to help</a> at the Fedora booth at <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedoraEvents/OhioLinuxFest/OhioLinuxFest2008" target="_self">OLF</a>.  David brought it up and within a few minutes we had most of the spots filled.

As an <a href="http://2008.utosc.com/" target="_blank">event organizer</a>, I understand the importance of having a booth manned at all times.  If you have a moment, head on over to the OLF Planning page on the wiki and add your name to a slot.  We could use at least 2-3 people in every spot.

There will be a 'USB Creation Station' there run by my little 7&#8243; ASUS EEE PC as well as some XO laptops and other cool swag like stickers, t-shirts and <a href="http://rose.public.iastate.edu/fedora-buttons.jpg" target="_blank">buttons</a> (thanks John).

Thanks to Jeffrey Tadlock for heading up the organization and it will be great to see him at <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FAD/FADNA2008" target="_blank">FADNA on Sunday </a>as well.  It will be great to meet all the gang and put faces to names.  Don't forget to bring your camera!!

Cheers,

Herlo
