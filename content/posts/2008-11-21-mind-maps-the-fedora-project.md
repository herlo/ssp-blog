Recently, I've been plagued with trying to come up with an organizational model for the [Utah Open Source Foundation][1] and it's relationship to the [Utah Open Source Conference][2].  This is in addition to the new Non-Profit structure we're building.

To that end, I created a very shabby hierarchical structure which I passed around a week ago at the Core Team after conference dinner.  It went over okay, but people had a lot of questions about how the structure was organized and what not.

### Organizing My Thoughts is Hard!

I didn't know what exactly to do.  As it is, I've never been an integral part of an organization before like this one.  Nor have I **ever** created organizational charts that were very well done.  I don't think that's going to change anytime soon.  But, something amazing did happen in the span between last Friday and today, that was VYM, or <a href="http://www.insilmaril.de/vym/" target="_blank">View Your Mind</a>.

When a &#8220;Mind Map&#8221; was first suggested to me by my buddy Doran Barton, I thought &#8220;well, I'll look into that later&#8221;.  However, the more I kept trying to cram jobs into places they didn't go, the more I got frustrated that there wasn't a good application to accommodate the structure I was trying to build.

VYM is an application that helps get your thoughts out onto a structure.  It lets you move it around quickly and easily and even associate pictures and notes where applicable.  The problem for me was understanding how to use VYM in an environment I already knew and UTOS was not the right place!

### The Fedora Project &#8220;Mind Map&#8221;

It turns out that a lot of people always wonder how the [Fedora Project][3] is structured, where the pieces go and who, what, where and how the project is put together.  Because I could at least see all the pieces, I decided that would be a good place to start.  While it's not complete by any means, I present to you the <a href="http://herlo.fedorapeople.org/files/fedoraproject-map.vym" target="_blank">Fedora Project VYM &#8220;Mind Map&#8221;</a>.  From VYM, one can create pdf, png and other output sources, so I created a [pdf][4] as well

#### Contribute!

I'd like to see the Fedora Community take this up and add many pieces to it as it grows and builds into something more than I could make.  It's fairly simple to add pieces as well.  You can create separate maps which can be integrated into the larger map.  Or, since the format is a zip file (essentially) with an xml definition file, I believe patches could work.

Cheers,

Herlo
