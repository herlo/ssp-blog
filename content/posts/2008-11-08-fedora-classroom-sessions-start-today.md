In just under 3 hours, I'll be giving my presentation on SELinux Basics.  There are many other great presentations today as well.  The schedule is available at <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Communicate/IRC/Classroom" target="_blank">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Communicate/IRC/Classroom</a>

Come by #fedora-classroom irc channel (on <a href="http://irc.freenode.net/" target="_blank">irc.freenode.net</a>) today at 20:00 UTC (3:00pm EST for the timezone challenged)

Cheers,

Herlo
