I am excited to be speaking at the SouthEast LinuxFest tomorrow!! The presentation about one of my latest projects, [GoOSe Linux â€“ Rebuilding Enterprise Linux the 'Community' Way][1]. The presentation will take place at [1:30pm on Friday, June 8][2]. If you ever were curious how Enterprise Linux is built in an open and transparent way, come by and listen. It will be entertaining and enlightening.

The Fedora project will be putting on a Beefy Miracle lunch across the street from SELF on Saturday (I think it's at noon) so come by and get a Beefy Miracle in honor of [Fedora 17][3].

Also, stop by the Fedora booth sometime during the weekend with your canned goods we'll be collecting this weekend for the <a title="Loaves and Fishes" href="http://www.loavesandfishes.org" target="_blank">Loaves and Fishes food pantry </a>in Charlotte, NC. Their priority list includes canned meats, canned pasta (such as spaghetti'os, ravioli, etc.), cereal, canned fruit, and 100% fruit juice. Nothing in glass, please!

Plus, you'll get a little surprise in return. I won't give it away, but as you might have guessed it's something that is definitely beefy.  ![:)][4]Hope to see you there!

There are quite a few other goodies on the schedule, so please feel free to peruse. It should be a great weekend!

Cheers,

herlo
