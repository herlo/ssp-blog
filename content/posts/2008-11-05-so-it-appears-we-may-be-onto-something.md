As of this afternoon, between myself and <a title="Steven Moix" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Moixs" target="_blank">Steven Moix</a>, it appears that almost all of the Fedora 10 Tour will be ready for the upcoming release.  <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Tours/Fedora10" target="_blank">Check it out for yourself</a>, we're only missing the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/10/ReleaseSummary" target="_blank">release summary</a> which should be written very soon.

Also, I should note that the countdown has already started:

Also, <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/get-prerelease" target="_blank">F10 Preview </a>came out yesterday during the election so nobody probably noticed.  Get yours today!

Cheers,

Herlo
