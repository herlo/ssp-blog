Some of you may have read this from twitter, apparently the twitter updater plugin is broken and alerts people of published content no matter the date.

Just a quick reminder about the upcoming [Fedora 10 Installfest/Release Party][1] previously announced.  Fedora 10 has been released and it's time to party.  Alongside the party will be food, fun and of course an **installfest**, so bring those 'puters and boxen to the 'fest!

Cheers,

Herlo
