I don't know about you, but I believe that this name is the best ever! Its well timed too, seeing as a late October release was planned.

I suppose Moonshine was good for Fedora 7, and Ubuntu does its naming convention with the latest being Gusty Gibbon. I have to say though that for sure Werewolf for fedora 8 takes the cake!

I love the name, great choice! I look forward to the November 10 <a href="http://www.utosf.org/2007/10/01/multi-distro-release-party/" target="_blank">Multi-Distro Release Party</a>. We can celebrate fedora 8 along with all the other distributions being released this month. Isn't it exciting!

Cheers,

Herlo
