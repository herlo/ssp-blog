It's time to announce April's presentation, it's looking to be great.

**Cooking with PAM**

Thad Van Ry will cover the basics of Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). If you're a Sys Admin who wants to know how PAM can help you or hurt you, this meeting is for you. Thad will go over the different stacks available as well as how to call modules and their control flags.

Thad is a Linux System Administrator for the LDS Church. He has been using Linux in his work life for the past 12+ years.
