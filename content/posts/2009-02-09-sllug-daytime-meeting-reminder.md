Hi all,

Just wanted to give you all a quick reminder that the first SLLUG (daytime SIG) meeting will be this Wednesday, Feb 11 from 11:30am-1pm

The first meeting I will present 'Fedora Remix: Custom distributions based upon proven design'

I should also mention that I'll be bringing some swag to give away.  I have some cool computer bags and a copy of the latest openSUSE 11.1 boxed edition to give away.

I've included the details about location again below.  For particulars inside the library, [read my previous post][1].

If you have questions, feel free to email me directly <herlo1 AT gmail>.
