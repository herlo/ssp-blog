As mentioned previously, there will be a [Sysadmin Study Group workshop at FUDCon][1].

**Now we're announcing the **Sysadmin Study Group will be the** [Fedora Activity Day at SCaLE 10x][2]!**

### So Exciting!

Well, it's been a week since the first run of my ec2 instances for the SysadminSG (or System Administrators Study Group).Things look promising. The folks over in #fedora-cloud and #boxgrinder have been especially helpful! Thanks a ton msavy and gholms and rbergeron too!

The plan here is to grant every user in a room access to an ec2 instance for 24-hours. It may be shorter or longer, depending on a few unknowns at this time. After some additional testing tonight, I think just a bit more work and the workshop will ready. We still need to update the [Study Guide][3] to match the RHEL6 [RHCSA exam][4] and [RHCE exam][5] requirements, so if anyone wants to take that on, just let me know and I'll point you in the right direction.

If you are looking to do some RHCE prep with others, come on down to the Sysadmin SG workshop at either FUDCon Blacksburg or SCaLE 10x! We look forward to seeing you there!

Cheers,

Herlo
