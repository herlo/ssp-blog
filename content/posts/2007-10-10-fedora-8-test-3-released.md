I'm loving this, 4 distros released within one month. Of course fedora is one of them! Fedora 8 Test 3 came out last Thursday, and I've been playing with it a little.

It has a nice new look and feel, some cool new <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/8/FeatureList" title="Fedora 8 Feature List" target="_blank">features</a> including CodecBuddy, OnlineDesktop and improvements in Bluetooth, NetworkManager and PulseAudio (improved sound quality).

I'm really excited to see all of the talk about these cool new features and looking forward to helping you all install this great wonderful distro (along with Ubuntu, OpenSUSE and OpenBSD) on November 10 at the <a href="http://www.utosf.org/2007/10/01/multi-distro-release-party/" title="Utah Open Source Foundation Multi-Distro Release Party at the OSTC" target="_blank">Multi-Distro Release Party</a> at the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yprnqr" title="Directions to the OSTC" target="_blank">OSTC</a>.

I've also included a few screenshots for the curious onlooker:
