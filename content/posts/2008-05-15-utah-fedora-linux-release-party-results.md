Well, usually I forget to take pictures, because either A) I forget my camera [I brought it this time] or 2) I get wrapped up in the event and forget to bring it with me.  But this release party, I plain just forgot to charge my batteries for my camera, oops!

Fortunately, I was able to snap a few pictures with some of the spare, also not fully-charged, batteries I did have on hand.  However, others took many pictures and I've listed them below.

  * <a href="http://designsimply.com" target="_blank">Sheri Bigelow</a> took some <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/designsimply/sets/72157604891582963/" target="_blank">great pictures</a>.  She is a great local photographer, web designer and the local webmistress.
  * <a href="http://useopensource.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Tristan Rhodes</a>, a local Asterisk Entrepreneur posted a good <a href="http://useopensource.blogspot.com/2008/05/utah-release-party-ubuntu-fedora.html" target="_self">blog post</a>.
  * Here's the <a href="http://herlo.smugmug.com/gallery/4866147_35UtQ#289916297_2tcQbhttp://herlo.smugmug.com/gallery/4866147_35UtQ#289916297_2tcQb" target="_blank">pictures I took</a>.  Not nearly as many, or as good.

To summarize the party, much celebration was had with foosball, a chess game on one of the largest chess boards around, video games, air hockey and much more was provided by <a href="http://codegreene.com" target="_blank">CodeGreene</a>.  The <a href="http://fedoraproject.org" target="_blank">FedoraProject</a> and <a href="http://utos.org" target="_blank">Utah Open Source</a> sponsored the food and prizes.  If you've never had a Chipotle burrito, they are the best burritos around.

I was able to spend time with about 5-7 people myself sharing the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/en/get-prerelease" target="_blank">Preview Release of Fedora 9</a> (codename Sulphur) including two who had never had previous success with Fedora or Linux in general.  It was very satisfying to see things work for them.

The <a href="http://ubuntu.com" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> folks were there in strength as well.  The <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/804" target="_blank">Hardy Heron</a> (8.04) CDs were being passed out, while we Fedoran's provided LiveUSB versions.  I even saw people taking advantage and obtaining both!  Its great to see communities come together and celebrate together.

The party continued at Salt Lake Pizza & Pasta for another couple hours.  Lot's of talk about the releases, upcoming events, and general mayhem took place including having Heartsbane shoot beer through his nose when I swore at him!

All in all, quite a successful evening and I look forward to helping others in November at our next release party.

Cheers,

Herlo
