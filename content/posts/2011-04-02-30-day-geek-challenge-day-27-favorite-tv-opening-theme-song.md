_This post is part of my '[30-day Geek Challenge][1]'.  As I stated, the order isn't important, nor will I do one per day.  Feel free to make your own list, or copy mine and participate.  Should be a lot of fun!_

Okay folks, this is probably one of the easier ones in my mind.  When I was a kid, I loved to watch the [General Lee][2] driving all over those hillbilly back roads of the South.  The [Dukes of Hazzard][3], were my favorite to watch 'out-Duke' Boss Hogg and his sidekick 'Rosco P. Coltrane' every week.  I would watch for Cooter and Uncle Jesse to come along and help out the Duke boys when they needed it the most.  And of course, when things got really dire, their very sexy cousin [Daisy Duke][4], would pretend to stand out on the side of the road with a broken-down car.

Although an attempt to remake the [Dukes of Hazzard][5] into a movie more or less bombed in 2005, I thought it was a good attempt.  You just can't do it right without [Tom Wopat][6], [John Schneider][7] and [Catherine Bach][8].

But this article is about the theme song.  It's a doozy!  [The Good Ol' Boys, written and sung by none other than Waylon Jennings][9] made the exciting chases just that much better.  The song hit **number 1** the Billboard magazine Hot Country Singles in 1980.

I've also included [a link to the theme song][10] for your enjoyment.

Cheers,
