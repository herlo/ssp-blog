[Here's the announcement][1] from [Fedora Project][2] Leader, Jared Smith.

Several new features are available, many which I am excited about.

  * GNOME 3 desktop environment – built from awesome!
  * Btrfs filesystem now optionally available
  * Better crash reporting
  * Better SELinux support
  * More apps in live media thanks to XZ compression
  * Better power management
  * LibreOffice replaces OpenOffice
  * Firefox 4
  * Systemd – the new and better replacement for SYSV init
  * [And much, much more][3]&#8230;

[Download][4] and [share (via bittorrent)][5] the latest release of joy and happiness. Fedora 15 is here!

Cheers,

Herlo
