Not that I was bored, I wasn't!  Not that I didn't have anything else to do, I do!  Not that there isn't more to do, there is!  It's just that I have been spending a little bit more time using [Fedora Talk][1] lately and I noticed a few things were missing.

First, there wasn't (and still isn't) any good instructions for setting up the Grandstream GXP 2000 with Fedora Talk.  I spent a good bit of time with Jon Stanley and Ian Weller who helped me get past this hurdle.  I would say that it's much easier to set up Twinkle than it is the Grandstream VoIP phone.  But it's all configured now, so I'm pretty happy.  I should get some energy in the next week or two to get up a page for this as well.

But that's not why I am blogging this!  Instead, I spent some time today with Ian Weller to get some new [Conference Bridges][2] up on Fedora Talk, which he did in a snap.  I then proceeded to code a new page that describes the current conference bridges available within Fedora Talk.  If you didn't know, there are several already set up for many sub-projects along with the 5 new 'General' conference bridges.

I sure hope you all enjoy the new availability, configure [twinkle][3] and start chatting more and more on Fedora Talk!

Cheers,

Herlo
