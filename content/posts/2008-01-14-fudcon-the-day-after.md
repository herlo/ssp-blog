So I'm back at work today after a **very** hard Sunday (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/fudcon" target="_blank">fudpub</a> was not friendly to me) at the slack^H^H^H^H^Hhackfest. However, I have to say that it was probably the **best** learning experience one could have at a conference. The BarCamp concept really worked well and I think it gave me some much needed information to move ahead on projects with which lately, I'd been struggling.

In addition to all of the learning, I was able to meet some really cool people there. Of course, there were my friends, Jared Smith, Evan McNabb and Derek &#8220;goozbach&#8221; Carter, and it was great to see them.

_But I didn't just come for my friends, and it was great to meet so many others._ 

I met Paul Frields when Jared introduced me. He quickly informed me, that Paul would be the &#8220;New Max&#8221;. After spending the last 2.25 days near or around Paul, I think he'll be a great leader. And to be honest, it feels to me as he'll put his own stamp on things. Not to take away from what Max has done, and will do, but I think Paul will be an awesome leader and I look forward to his friendship and leadership.

I was able to visit with Jim Whitehurst, the new Red Hat CEO. He stopped me to ask about my Eeep c and what I thought. We talked for a good 5 minutes before I realized who he was, and then I congratulated him on the job and said I expected great things :) He was quite excited to see the Eeep and it was awesome to know how passionate he was about Fedora. And to take the time out on a Saturday, that's awesome!

A few more people I met who were awesome and friendly: Michael DeHaan, Karsten Wade, Seth Vidal, Russell Harrison,Toshio Kuratomi and another who's name escapes me (who I helped get lost somewhere near Cary and Apex) and so many more names I cannot recall, though I'll not forget your faces. Thank you for your valuable time and helping me get acclimated to this awesome community. I'd like to thank everyone who spent time helping us naive souls learn the way of the Fedora.

In the future, I plan to take much of what I learned and start working with it in my spare time. I've also started the process of joining the documentation project and look forward to helping them. My ambassador duties are simple enough that I can continue doing that as well, so this year should be a good year.

Thanks again to my company Guru Labs, for helping me arrange my schedule around FUDCon and hopefully they'll be as accommodating for Scale next month.

Cheers,

Herlo
