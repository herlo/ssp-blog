Utah Open Source is preparing for the future. While we are not having a Utah Open Source Conference in 2011, we're getting ready to gear up for UTOSC 2012 along with a ton of community events throughout 2011 To do this, however, we need help.

## WE NEED YOU

Come by the UTOS Project day from 9am to 11am to hear what we have planned for the future and how you can help.

Date: May 28
  
Time: 9am to 11am
  
Where: Open Source Technology Center @ Novell ([map][1])

We're growing again and UTOS has some excellent opportunities available. I highly suggest you consider supporting this organization as we cannot put on an awesome conference and community events without volunteers. I'll be there, cheering you all on and helping UTOS grow open source.

You can find more details on the [UTOS Project Day][2] website and the [Utah Open Source Blog][3].

I look forward to seeing who shows up and is ready to make UTOS the best open source community around!

Cheers,

Herlo
