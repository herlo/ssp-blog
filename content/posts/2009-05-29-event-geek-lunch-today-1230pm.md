I'm going to this month's Geek Lunch in Salt Lake at My Thai.  If you've never been there, the lunch specials are not only cheap, but tasty!  If you're near the Salt Lake area today around 12:30 to 2:00, come enjoy some good Thai!  There is also a Geek Lunch in the Davis/Weber and Provo areas.  Here is that info:
