At about 11pm last night, our presenter sent me a message indicating that there were some unresolvable conflicts and I wanted to get the word out that today's meeting has been cancelled.  I'll be up at the Salt Lake Public Library to hang out and chat for an hour about whatever you all want, but there will be no presentation.

I apologize for the last minute notice.  I'm hoping to have the Basics of Puppet presentation next month.

Cheers,

Herlo
