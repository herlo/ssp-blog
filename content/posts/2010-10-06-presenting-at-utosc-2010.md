Hi all,

Well, as you probably know, I am the originator and current manager of the [Utah Open Source Conference][1].  As it turns out, this year, I am also presenting on a topic I've been working on for quite some time.  If you haven't already, [register for the conference][2] and come see my presentation.

I'm presenting [FreeSeeR: Capturing audio and video on the cheap][3], a talk about recording audio and video using completely free software and the best hardware at the lowest prices.

Also, all of our conference presentations this year are going to be recorded using FreeSeer.  This will be a fun and exciting experiment as FreeSeeR has been proven to work well in a conference environment.

I'm really excited to be sharing this information and meeting friends old and new.  I sure hope you can make it to the conference and possibly my presentation as well.

Cheers,

Herlo
