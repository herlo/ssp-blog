Ladies and Gentleman, Boys and Girls, may I have your attention please!

You know, I've always enjoyed that statement.  I love hearing it over the PA at the circus, at a restaurant when someone is about to make an announcement, or at a the start of a presentation at a conference.  Not sure why, but it just gets me all excited about the world, the future and I perk up wide-eyed with anticipation of what's going to happen next&#8230;

I'm as excited as ever to say these words myself.  I'm so happy, in fact, that I wanted to share it with you, my dear audience.  My friends, colleagues, fellow UTOS compatriots, I would like to share with you some wonderful news!  The future is bright for free and open source software right here in our fine state.

Just look around you and you will see companies coming into Utah right and left.  While some do not appear open source friendly, don't be fooled, they want you with your amazing Linux skills, or incredible Python Fu.  It's you they want, Miss PHP master, scripting fiend, fanciful master of kickstart!  The real question though, will be, where will these companies look for their talent?

In my opinion, they will look to the great technical community already here in Utah.  They will strive to find and hire the best and brightest from our ranks.  They will want to hire those from our communities of experts, skilled craftsman, coders, system administrators and much, much more.  It is my belief that they will want to hire from those of you who participate in our Local User Groups and directly with Utah Open Source.

I say these things with great fervor and joy.  I'd like to announce the 2011 theme of Utah Open Source, 'Community'.

My departure from the Executive Director position leaves me to work more closely with the UTOS board of directors.  In my stead, Victor Villa will take the responsibilities and leadership of the Executive Director.

Victor comes to UTOS with a great deal of community leadership.  As the former president of the Utah PHP User Group for the past several years, Victor grew the local PHP community every year.  He's been a great supporter of UTOS since its inception in 2006.  With his foresight and leadership, I know that UTOS will continue to grow and flourish.  I am excited to pass the baton of leadership of UTOS to a man I have grown to admire and appreciate. Thank you Victor for taking on the role of leading Utah Open Source into this bright future!

During our conversations, I've asked Victor to spend some extra time during 2011 focusing on community growth and development.  With this in mind, Victor and I agree that 2011 will be a year of community building.  In 2012, the Utah Open Source Conference will return.  I will let Victor respond to my comments, with a post of his own, addressing the rest of his vision for UTOS.  I'm truly excited to be a part of UTOS, and with all of the goals Victor has set forth, I am very excited for the future!

Thank you for letting me be part of this community.  I will never forget you.  I will miss you all so very much when our family moves to Southern California in the fall.

Much Joy and Excitement,

Your friend,

Clint
