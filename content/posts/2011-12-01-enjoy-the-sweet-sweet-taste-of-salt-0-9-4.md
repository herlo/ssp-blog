If you haven't heard, [salt 0.9.4 has arrived][1]. If you haven't used salt before, I'd highly suggest reading about it [here][2].

I have now [RPMs built][3] for [Fedora][4] and [EPEL6][5] (EPEL5 requires some outside help). They are available from my [personal repository on fedorapeople.org][3]. If you are interested in trying them out, you can just grab the [repo definition][3] for your system.

### A review request

Salt development moves very fast. In the past 2 weeks or so, I've posted 2 new releases for salt in [my review request][6]. I'd really like to get salt into the Fedora and EPEL repositories, but I need this review to be completed. I will happily do a review swap!!

Cheers,

Herlo
