Hi all,

It's actually been a while since I've posted anything here and I thought I'd better let anyone listening know about the annual BBQ Otis and I hold down at our house in Springville. Last year, we had quite a good time, approximately 70 people showed up from around the neighborhood, family and friends.

This year will be bigger and better! We're including a movie (family approved) at 9pm, along with additional bbq options. Check out the info here:

If you've not been down this way, I highly recommend spending a couple hours enjoying the nice new grass we've planted as well as some of the good eats that will be available. If last year was any indication, this year will be bigger and better. Hope to see any/all of you there.

Cheers,

Herlo
