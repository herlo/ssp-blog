This month's session will be just on Saturday from 01:30 to 06:30 UTC (see][2] if you aren't sure what times those are in your neighborhood).  We've got some good coverage of how Yum works, a little internationalization and updates on the new features in Fedora 11 (the Alpha just came out today).

I always find these sessions enlightening so come on by and participate!

Cheers,
