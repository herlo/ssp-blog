Hi all,

Just a quick reminder to all of you out there who might be considering submitting a paper for the [Utah Open Source Conference][1] coming up this October 7-9.  The [call for papers][2] is coming to a close on August 1 so hurry up and get it submitted :)  I'm planning on submitting a paper for [FreeSeer][3] and will likely also present on the State of UTOS at the conference.

Cheers,

Herlo
