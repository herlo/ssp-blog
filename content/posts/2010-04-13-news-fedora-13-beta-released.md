### [Get yours today!!][1]

From the [announcement][2] by Jesse Keating:

<pre>The countdown is on: Fedora 13, "Goddard," is set to launch in mid-May.
Fedora is the leading edge, free and open source operating system that
continues to deliver innovative features to users worldwide, with a new
release every six months.

But wait! What's that? You can't wait a whole month to try out the
latest and greatest in Fedora's leading-edge technologies? You want to
be the first to see what's new? Well, you're in luck. The Fedora 13 Beta
release is available NOW. Hop on board and take a tour of the rocking
new features.
</pre>

Get it [here][1]!!

I'm downloading the LiveCD version right now to try out on my laptop.Â  Consider helping out by [testing the new Fedora Beta][3] as well.

Cheers,
  
Herlo
