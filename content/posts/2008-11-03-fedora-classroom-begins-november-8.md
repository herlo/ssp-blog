Want to learn a new tool within Fedora?  Interested in getting a better hold on your skillset?  Want to share with others something you've learned?  Let us know at the newly formed Fedora Classroom.

As part of the marketing team meeting this week, Kevin Fenzi brought up the Fedora-Classroom.  While #fedora serves a good purpose of troubleshooting, there's more people can learn with some IRC tutorials.

I will be doing the first session on SELinux Basics, and there are other topics to fit those from beginner to advanced Fedora user.

From the email to the fedora-list:

I'm happy to announce that next weekend we will be opening up the #fedora-classroom irc channel (on <a href="http://irc.freenode.net/" target="_blank">irc.freenode.net</a>) for some classroom sessions.

These sessions are intended to be short (30min to an hour) sessions on the IRC network where you can learn about a specific Fedora related topic.

Please see: <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Communicate/IRC/Classroom" target="_blank">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Communicate/IRC/Classroom</a> to look at what topics will offered next week, what times they will be offered, suggest topics or sign up to teach a session yourself!

Hope to see lots of folks there.

Cheers,

Herlo
