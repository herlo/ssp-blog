Hi all.

As the founder of the <a href="http://www.utosc.org" target="_blank">Utah Open Source Conference</a> and one of its biggest proponents.  I just wanted to mention that if you hadn't already seen the post from the <a href="http://openclue.org/ut/" target="_blank">Utah Open Source Planet</a>, you will have now.

I am looking forwared to reading all of the outlines coming in over the next month.  Big things are afoot and much will happen in the coming days.  We anticipate a good load of submissions so get yours in early.

Lots of fun stuff will be presented we are sure, and choosing the presenters will be a lot of fun and I am sure looking forward to reviewing many outlines.

If you have anything, anything you want to talk about that relates even a little bit to Open Source in Utah, please submit it today.  You only have until the end of April to do so.

Cheers,

Herlo
