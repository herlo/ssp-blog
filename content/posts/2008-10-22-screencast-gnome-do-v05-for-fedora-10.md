Back in July, I built gnome-do from scratch, identifying and helping get a few bugs worked out along the way.  It was all in an effort to create a screencast on the future version of <a href="http://do.davebsd.com/" target="_blank">gnome-do</a> for Fedora 10.  Gnome-do appears to be based upon Quicksilver from Mac, but gnome-do is bound to surpass it quickly.

This functionality is available in the rawhide repository for those daring enough to try it, but since it requires Mono, it may require upgrades of other applications, like banshee, f-spot, tomboy and others.

**WARNING:** If you are not comfortable with beta software, wait for this to come out in Fedora 10.

Gnome-do is a great little app to help those who really wish to use more discrete movements but like full-fledged desktops in a graphical user interface (GUI).  Gnome-do is definitely going somewhere in v0.5 and has some really cool plugins.  Now I need to learn how to write plugins&#8230;

I really enjoyed doing this screencast, and beware it's 25MB.
