**UPDATE!**

A quick update for those who are planning on attending tonight's <a href="http://www.utos.org/2008/01/17/utosf-hacking-night/" target="_blank">UTOSF HackNight</a>. Its been moved to <a href="http://gurulabs.com" target="_blank">Guru Labs</a> in Bountiful. If you still need a ride, feel free to email me, herlo1@gmail or you can twitter me at <a href="http://twitter.com/herlo" target="_blank">http://twitter.com/herlo</a>.

If you still need a ride up, we'll carpool/caravan up from <a href="http://tinyurl.com/29v5dn" target="_blank">my place</a> **@6:30** (instead of 7pm) in Murray. I'll be leaving promptly at 6:30, however. If you've never been to Guru Labs, here's a <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2348yy" target="_blank">map</a>.

See you all tonight for an awesome hackfest!

Cheers,

Herlo
