Hi all,

Just another quick reminder that if you are an Ambassador in North America and are wanting to get your input in on what will happen at FAD – NA, come to the meeting tonight.  It will be at 20:00 EDT in #fedora-ambassadors on irc.freenode.net.

Previously, I stated that this was for North American Regional Ambassadors.  I was corrected recently that it could be for any Ambassador with interest, so please feel free to put your $.02.

Sorry for the confusion.

Cheers,

Herlo
