While doing my normal reading about new features in Fedora, I came across this snippet in the rsyslogd man page. The section I was reading was in regards to how to deal with security threats.

<pre>4.     Disabling inet domain sockets will limit risk to the local machine.

5.     Use  step  4  and  if  the  problem persists and is not secondary to a rogue program/daemon get a 3.5 ft (approx. 1 meter)
       length of sucker rod* and have a chat with the user in question.

       Sucker rod def. â€” 3/4, 7/8 or 1in. hardened steel rod, male threaded on each end.  Primary use  in  the  oil  industry  in
       Western  North  Dakota  and other locations to pump 'suck' oil from oil wells.  Secondary uses are for the construction of
       cattle feed lots and for dealing with the occasional recalcitrant or belligerent individual.</pre>

Quite a good chuckle!

Cheers,
