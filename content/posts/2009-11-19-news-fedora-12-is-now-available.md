I've been running [Fedora 12][1] for about a month now (Beta first, Alpha before that).  It's the best Fedora to date.

**Everything Just Works(TM).**

I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have a system working with [great sound][2], awesome graphics and very usable GNOME and KDE desktops.  I really like the new NetworkManager features and the ability to tether any device, vpnc and other easy-to-configure options.  KVM support is much improved with the new [libguestfs][3] improvements.

Fedora 12 _media_ should be available on December 3, if you are a Fedora Ambassador in North America, [start requesting media][4]* for your events (and [ambassador kits][5]).

You can [get your copy][6] today!!

Cheers,

Herlo

*******NOTE**: This request page is not for the [freemedia][7] project. You must be a [Fedora Contributor][8] to request media.  [Join the Fedora Project][8] today and help us continue making Fedora the best operating system!!
