My friend [Nushio][1] recently posted about how he's doing a list called '[30-day geek challenge][2]', so I thought I'd do the same and see how it goes.  The concept is simple, just explain your choices from a list similar to this one.  I modified his list slightly, but the overall theme is there.  If you have suggestions or thoughts regarding the days, I'd love to hear it.

In my case, I might try to do this every day, but probably won't.  I may also do them out of order, so feel free to do the same.  I will try to do at least one every week.  Enjoy the list, and the follow-ups for each of the days.  In my mind, this is a good experience to remind me why I enjoy being a Geek, maybe it will help you as well.
