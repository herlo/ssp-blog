This month we're getting back on track with the Salt Lake Linux User Group Daytime meeting at BetaLoft.  Our presenter this month is C.R. Oldham and he had this to say about the presentation:

RSSCloud is an open protocol which creates a loosely-coupled Twitter-like network of people and 140 character status messages.  In plainer language, it enables real-time status updates on anything that can be pushed via RSS.  Why should you care?  Come to the SLLUG daytime SIG meeting to find out.

More information can be found at <http://rsscloud.org/>

So why not come down to BetaLoft next Wednesday, November 11, from 11:30am-1pm and learn about RSSCloud.
