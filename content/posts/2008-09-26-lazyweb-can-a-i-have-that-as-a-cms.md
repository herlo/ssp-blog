So I was following up on a talk I had seen at djangocon this year, and ran across this site by Cal Henderson – <a href="http://www.iamcal.com/" target="_blank">http://www.iamcal.com/</a>

The interesting part about this site is that he has about 10-12 different elements on his front page sharing information about what was going on, etc. in his life.  I am interested in implementing something similar, but couldn't find any reference to a cms that he might be using.

To give a little background, I've followed a few links off his site, including the one to the designer of the site, which also indicates no cms that they use either.  It seems I may be out of luck, but wondered if anyone else had seen a cms similar or that might be capable of such features without major modifications??

I've looked at drupal and joomla and am more interested in something a little more like concrete5 or django-cms, but haven't settled on anything.  So LazyWeb, do you think you can help me?
