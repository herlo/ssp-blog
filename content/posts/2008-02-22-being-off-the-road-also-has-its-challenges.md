I will be home for the entire week next week, which is the first time that's happened this month. Not that I am complaining, but once I get home I have a very long laundry list of items to complete and only 6.5 days to complete it in until I go back on the road. So here's the short list:

  * Generic stuff that can be done anytime during the week 
      * Laundry from the past week
      * Put my bed together at my new home – I have been in this house now for two months, still no real bed
      * Finish unpacking all of the boxes left under the stairs – working on not being a packrat so much of the stuff is bound to get tossed out
      * Put an ad in the paper for a roommate – save money this way
      * Work on the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Docs/Drafts/GetInvolvedGuide" target="_blank">Fedora GI Guide</a>
  * <a href="http://voxpopdesign.com/wordpress/?p=117" target="_blank">CodeAway</a> Saturday from noon to 6pm – good times
  * <a href="http://www.utos.org/2008/02/22/utosf-hacknight-refactor-conman/" target="_blank">UTOSF HackNight</a> Saturday night, 7pm – more good times (gotta get call for papers out)
  * Sleep in **all** day Sunday – my only real day of rest, but that's the life I lead, this may lead a little into Monday as well
  * <a href="http://gamesutah.org" target="_blank">BoardGames</a> on Tuesday night with friends I've not seen for a couple months – that'll be nice
  * Lunch with my friend Tristan on Wednesday afternoon
  * Two meetings Wednesday night at Applebees in Draper 
      * Centralized Calendaring among multiple communities – 6p
      * UTOSC Planning Meeting – 8p
  * Two events as well on Thursday I'd like to attend 
      * <a href="http://www.windley.com/cto_forum" target="_blank">CTO Breakfast </a>Thursday morning would be worthwhile, we'll see if I make it down there
      * <a href="http://voxpopdesign.com/wordpress/?p=116" target="_blank">Geek/Blogger Dinner</a> on Thursday night
  * Friday will bring something, but currently, there's nothing. Maybe I'll try to keep it free.
  * Oh, and I still have to work on Thursday and Friday, so I guess I'll work that in somehow as well

Whew! I'm excited to be home though, and am sure this list will grow!

Cheers,

Herlo
