Welcome to my disappointment.  Welcome to my frustration.  Welcome, welcome to my **not** being able to attend <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon/FUDConF10" target="_blank">FUDCon</a>!  Did I mention I was frustrated and disappointed?  Well, if I didn't, I am!

Here's the story.

Many of you probably know that I work for <a href="http://gurulabs.com" target="_blank">Guru Labs</a>, and as such, I teach Linux for a living.  This coming week, I was on my way, I really was, to New York City to teach a Local System Administration class.

It was all set.  I was going to fly from NYC to Boston on Friday afternoon after my class.  The room was booked at the conference, I even had committed to helping do video recordings of each of the FUDCon attendees (something like 150 of them) on cheese.

Then Friday the 13th happened&#8230;.

Normally, I like Friday the 13th, and with the exception of this event, it was a great one.  At the last minute, I was informed the class had been cancelled.  Now, this isn't an abnormal thing and usually I'm not this upset about a class being cancelled.  Saying that means I was banking on some things which normally pull through, but they didn't  All in all, I'm only frustrated that I can't go to FUDCon!

I tried hard to still go.  In fact, I finagled and attempted to convince any of the other instructors I could into letting me teach their class.  I hit up my friends for $600, all to no avail.  The cost of the hotel was $400 already, adding another $600 is not in my budget, I'm afraid.  And people say that airlines don't make any money!

So I will miss you all and the wonderful barcamp sessions I was planning on attending. I'll miss <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Pfrields" target="_blank">Paul</a>'s first State of Fedora address.  I'll miss chatting <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SethVidal" target="_blank">Seth</a> up about yum, <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/TomCallaway" target="_blank">Spot</a> about RPM and politics in general, or <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/MichaelDeHaan" target="_blank">Michael</a> about cobbler and func.  In fact, I wanted to spend a bit of time talking with Jef about video and gstreamer, but I guess I'll just have to wait until FUDCon F11 in 2009 :(

Could someone video record each of them and post them?  Or at least the audio?  Hehe, I know that's a lot of work, but hey, it can't hurt to ask.  In fact, if you are willing to stream audio, I have an IceCast server and I'd be happy to help configure your client to accomplish this task.

Cheers,

Clint
