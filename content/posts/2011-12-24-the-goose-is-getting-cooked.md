As of this [morning][1], it appears we only have around 40 failed builds! We're getting very close! I think we could make an alpha by the end of next week with a good bit of sprinting! As I understand it, [one is planned for next week][2], maybe we should sit down and figure out those details?

Cheers,

Clint
