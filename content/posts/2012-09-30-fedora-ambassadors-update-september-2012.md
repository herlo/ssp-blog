## For those of you keeping score at home

As you may have noticed, Joerg (kital) has retired from performing the FAMA duties, and I have taken over. I would personally like to thank him for his excellent work.

Since I'm now in charged of FAMA, I'm modifying the process to fit my availability. Essentially, this means two things:

  1. All ambassador applications will be processed on a weekly basis (this usually means a Sunday morning). If I am going to be unavailable on Sunday, I'll try to get it done as soon as possible before/after that time.
  2. Welcome notices will only go out once a month, in an update email / post. This post is the first of the monthly posts.

If you have any questions, you can email me or find me in #fedora-ambassadors on irc.freenode.net (herlo is my fas and irc nick).

Cheers,

Herlo
