So I was surfing around earlier today, and was given a link to the Utah Open Source Planet at <a target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://openclue.org/ut/">http://openclue.org/ut/</a> and found this cool link to [Gcast][1]. Being somewhat new to the whole Podcasting idea, I am gonna sign on and see what it is all about, learn how to podcast my first show and see if its for me. Wish me luck.
