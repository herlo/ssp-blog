Recently, I've been very interested in getting involved more and more with the Fedora Project.  In fact, the latest project in which I'm involved, the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Docs/Drafts/GetInvolvedGuide" target="_blank">Getting Involved Guide</a> (GIG).

I started with this guide because my so-called friend Jared Smith (hi Jared!), introduced me to the original creator of this document, Paul Frields at FUDCon a couple months ago.  I started the hackfest portion, not entirely clear where I'd end up, but somehow I rolled back to hang with Jared and Paul while they were working on this Contributor Guide, if I remember the name correctly.  I got involved late in the day, and either my misunderstanding, or pure genius took over and the Contributor Guide (intended mainly for developers), quickly turned into the Getting Involved Guide or GIG, which had a much broader focus.

While I am happy to be a part of this guide, and have had a hand in changing its purpose, I'm not at all familiar with much of the Fedora Community processes.  Which, for this document to be successful, I am going to have to learn, since that's the point of this guide to begin with, helping others get started when they want to help the Fedora Project.
  
Think of it this way, if you are a corporate entity, an individual, or a small non-profit group (like my <a href="http://utos.org" target="_blank">UTOSF</a> group) and want to give back to the community that has helped you so much.  How do you do that?  What's involved in getting started?  What projects are out there where we can help?  Do we need to be developers? If not, what else is there for us to do?  Well, those are all good questions, and I am sure there are many, many more we haven't yet considered.

I guess what I am doing here is soliciting from the general communities at large, what they'd like to see in this guide.  What confused them about joining a large project.  I'd also like to hear stories about being a contributor to the Fedora Project, and why you think its a good idea.  I want to take these ideas and integrate them into the Getting Involved Guide.  I want to take these issues and make it clear for others **how** to get involved, why its important, and show that value.

Currently, if you are a Fedora Project member, I have a document in gobby.fedoraproject.org called GettingInvolvedGuide, which you are welcome to modify as you feel necessary.  I may also be hitting you up to answer questions regarding particular processes in your group as well.

Cheers,

Herlo
