So it looks like my whining and moaning paid off!  I didn't expect that anyone could help me, the money had been spent, things were cancelled and I was screwed!

I recieved a comment on my blog from Mo inviting me to stay at her and halfline's place for the weekend of FUDCon.  So nice, but I still didn't have the $600+ it would cost to come to FUDCon.

And then I received this email:

> Clint,
> 
> Don't cancel your trip.
> 
> Give me receipts,&#8230;
> 
> <span style="color: #888888;">–Max</span>

Wow! So I'm coming to FUDCon.  I'd like to thank Max, Mo, Paul (and any others I don't know about) for helping me get to Boston.  I'm sure it'll be a blast.

I've got some serious plans to make it worth Fedora's while :)  I don't think there's a better way than to be included in the community than to know people care about you and want you to be a part of the community as a whole and to succeed.  I'm going to do all I can to make sure the money will be well spent.

So as I said in my reply email to Max.  Thank you! thank you! thank you!  FUDCon will be a blast!

Cheers,

Herlo

PS – I would also like to thank my employer, <a href="http://gurulabs.com" target="_blank">Guru Labs</a>, for being so kind to let me attend my second FUDCon.
