In reply to a post by Larry Cafiero about the spelling of [SWAG][1], it's an backronym: Stuff We All Get (SWAG)

Here's some references to related defintions and such:

  * <http://www.acronymfinder.com/Stuff-We-All-Get-(SWAG).html>
  * <http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/swag>

I should mention that Larry has done an amazing job, managing the booth, dealing with the Fedora Kids (pictures to come) and helping all those who've come by and getting them to the right people.Â  Thank you Larry.

Cheers,

Herlo
