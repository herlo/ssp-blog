Hi all,

Just wanted to give you all a quick reminder that the first SLLUG (daytime SIG) meeting will be this Wednesday, March 11 from 11:30am-1pm.  Bring your sack lunch if you want to join in that new tradition.

This month's meeting will be 'LVM Basics' by Kevin Benko.  I'd like to thank Kevin for stepping up to present this topic.  LVM is quite awesome and useful.

I should also mention that I'll be bringing some swag to give away.  I have some cool computer bags to give away, so come on down and get your SWAG.

I've included the details about location again below.  For particulars inside the library, [read my previous post][1].

If you have questions, feel free to email me directly <herlo1 AT gmail>.
