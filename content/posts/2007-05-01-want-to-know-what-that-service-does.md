I regularly run services I don't need&#8230;until I find out what they do.  After that, I immediately (or semi-immediately) turn them off.  I was perusing Red Hat Magazine today and found a neat article that details just about every System V service available on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This list should be pretty applicable for Fedora Core 6 as well.  I looked at a few of the items on the list and those were explained pretty well.

Here's the link:  <a href="http://www.redhatmagazine.com/2007/03/09/understanding-your-red-hat-enterprise-linux-daemons/" title="http://www.redhatmagazine.com/2007/03/09/understanding-your-red-hat-enterprise-linux-daemons/" target="_blank">http://www.redhatmagazine.com/2007/03/09/understanding-your-red-hat-enterprise-linux-daemons/</a>

Enjoy!
