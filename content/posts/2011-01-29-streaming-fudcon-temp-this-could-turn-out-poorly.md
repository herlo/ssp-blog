So I've been recording and streaming [FUDCon][1] events over the past few years.  I think I started back in 2008 when FUDCon was at Boston University.  I'm still hoping to pull off streaming tomorrow at [FUDCon Tempe][2] for Jared Smith's (our new amazing Fedora Project Leader) talk around 10am MST.

But I kind of have a few problems&#8230;

  1. The icecast streaming server we previously setup on talk.fedoraproject.org appears to be off.  I'm hoping to get a hold of someone who knows what happened to it and see if we can get that turned back on in time.  Unfortunately, I've been busy with a million other things this weekend, so it's not been top priority.
  2. I used to have access to my own icecast server at stream.utos.org, but that server recently crashed, and I don't have it back up as of yet.
  3. Arizona State University technical staff, as amazing as they are, didn't know of my request for a wired connection until today.  Again, my fault for springing it on them last minute.  It's still possible they'll get it done, here's hoping!

Essentially, if these **three** things work out tomorrow, I still have to reconfigure my little PC to make streaming work.  That should be less painful and much more simple.

### BUT

**Just in case streaming doesn't happen, do not despair!** As an alternate, I do plan to have the audio of Jared's talk recorded.  Once I have it cleaned up as best I can tomorrow, it will get pasted on the FUDCon Tempe page and I will blog a direct link for your consumption.  It should be up by noon MST.

### AND

In lieu of streaming the sessions, don't forget to logon to #fedora-fudcon on irc.freenode.net tomorrow and follow the transcripts of each session.  This started at FUDCon Toronto last time, and should be a good resource for watching the event from afar.

Now, to get some sleep!

Cheers,

Herlo
