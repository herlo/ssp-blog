[FUDCon Blacksburg][1] is a little less than 3 weeks away and I can't believe it's almost here! So much to do, so little time, it will be a great event!

As some of you may know, I'm putting on a workshop, called [System Administrator Study Group][2]. If you haven't heard about this workshop, listen up!

SysadminSG as it's called, is to get Fedora contributors prepared for certain certification exams, specifically the [Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA)][3] and the [Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE)][4].

This workshop is not a place where you can come and earn either of these certifications. It is also not a course where you can get free instruction. Instead, this workshop is a hands-on place to sit down with others of like mind and work through the exam requirements as specified by Red Hat. If you have ever desired to get your RHCE certification, or just want to bone up on some of the qualifying skills, this is the place for you.

### A Test Run – 18:00 to 21:00 UTC – December 27, 2011

My hope is to have everything working on ec2 instances for participants in the workshop. In that sense, I'll be setting some things up in the morning tomorrow to make certain things work. It is clear to me that I'll need help from a few folks to test the setup I've created.

If you have an hour or so tomorrow during the above time frame, I'd love your help testing these instances. Please find me in #fedora-cloud on freenode (I'm herlo) and I'll set you up with your own 24-hour instance. I'll probably be in there asking gholms and others for help getting ec2 policies working, among other minor issues.

Cheers,

Herlo
