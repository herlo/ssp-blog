We're packing up to complete our trip, leaving Flagstaff this morning and arriving in Tempe this afternoon.  I'm excited to note that [FUDCon has provided a space at our hotel for social and hacking events throughout the weekend][1], starting Tomorrow.

Even though FUDCon officially doesn't start until Saturday morning, I'll down in the meeting room at the Courtyard playing board games and discussing nerdy things with my Fedora friends.  I've even brought a few board games with me to share.

  * [Power Grid][2] – Supply the most cities with power
  * [Pandemic][3] – Prevent a worldwide pandemic outbreak
  * [Small World][4] – Conquest and control of a world that is simply too small to accommodate them all.
  * [Metro][5] – Complete the longest rail lines against other players
  * [Perudo][6] – Sometimes called Liars Dice

There's also [a bigger list on the FUDCon Tempe wiki page][1].  If you are interested in these games, come and find me and let's play!

Cheers,

Herlo
