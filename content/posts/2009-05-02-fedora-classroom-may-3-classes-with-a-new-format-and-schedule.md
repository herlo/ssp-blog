This month's Fedora Classroom will be held this Saturday/Sunday (actually it's all Sunday UTC time).  We've got [four fun presentations][1] lined up for you with a new format to boot.

Essentially, the new idea is that we're going to let the presenters be flexible with their schedules.  Thus presentations can happen any time in a 24-hour period (from 00:00 to 23:00 UTC time) this Sunday, May 3.

It looks to be a much simpler thing to make work for everyone.  Presentations will be available afterword on our [Fedora Classroom Archive][2] as well, so if you can't stay up to watch it live, at least you can live it afterwards in the logs.

So you ask, who's presenting.  Well, check out the [Fedora Classroom wiki page][3] and find out.  It looks to be fun and there should be something for everyone.

See you all there!!

Cheers,

Herlo
