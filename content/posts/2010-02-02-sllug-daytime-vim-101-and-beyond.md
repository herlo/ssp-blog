Well, it's that time of month again, time to come to BetaLoftSLC, eat some lunch (brown bagging is encouraged) and listen to a good technical talk.  This month, we have Mr. Adam Barrett, a Senior Software Developer at SOS Staffing in Salt Lake City, who will be taking some time to talk with us about Vim.  Here is a little snippet from Adam:

## Vim 101 and Beyond

Vim is the editor of choice for many developers and power users. It's a &#8220;modal&#8221; text editor based on the vi editor written by Bill Joy in the 1970s for a version of UNIX. It inherits the key bindings of vi, but also adds a great deal of functionality and extensibility that are missing from the original vi. This session will cover the beginnings (101) and the first set of intermediate (201) modes and commands for vim.

If you would like to join us, just head on down via train, car (parking is free on the street for two hours just east and west of BetaLoftSLC), walk or bike to:
