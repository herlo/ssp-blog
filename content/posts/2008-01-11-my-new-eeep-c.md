This little machine is pretty nice. I'm getting used to the interface right now as the keyboard is a bit smaller than my normal T60p. A few keys are in a different spot, but overall, this little machine rocks!!

Probably my biggest headache right now is the right Shift key is further over than I regularly expect it to be. Have a look at the specs:

I'm hoping to take this over to FUDCon later today and help get it more solid for F9.

Pictures to come.
