I should have mentioned this earlier, but Fedora 7 Test 2 was released earlier this week. 

Here's the announcement: <http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2007-March/msg00000.html>

There are some subtle improvements so far:

  * Merger of Core and Extras – There is no core or extras anymore, there is only **Fedora 7**
  * Live CD Available – This is definitely cool and about time
  * Desktop Improvements – New theme and a better version of Gnome by default
  * Fast User Switching – I've not seen this concept before in Linux, looking forward to playing with this feature

All in all, things look promising. I am currently downloading the latest release and when I've had some time to evaluate these and some of the other cool features listed on the link above, I'll report back.

Cheers,

Clint
