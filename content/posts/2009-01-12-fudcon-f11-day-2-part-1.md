**8:05am:** Light flutters into the room.  More likely, I notice it at this time, it's probably been light for some time.  Climb out of warm bed, boy am I tired.  Today is the bar camp and I have audio recording to setup.

**8:35am:** Arrive at MIT for the FUDCon bar camp, grab a muffin, some juice and coffee.

**8:50am:** Complete set up of audio equipment, quickly down my juice and muffin.

**8:55am:** Head out to get some more food, but I only found some morsels left.  I snagged a small bit of bread left, and begin my return to the audio equipment.

**9:05am:** Streaming has begun, or so I think.  Darkice won't start, giving a strange error that the device wasn't there.  It turns out I've forgotten to plug in the usb cable from the mixer, so the first few minutes of Greg DeKoenigsberg's talk are missing.

**9:08am:** Plug in the usb cable and restart the stream.

**9:30am:** Pitch a session on the Fedora Classroom.

**9:40am:** Vote for my favorite sessions and hope others want to participate in the Fedora Classroom session.  As I we are voting, I chat with Dave Nalley, Ian Weller and Ricky Zhou about recording audio in whatever room they are in each hour.  It seems to be a good plan.

**9:50am:** Paul asks me to help get sessions scheduled, so I grab chalk and start crossing out sessions that have been scheduled.

**10:15am:** All the sessions are scheduled, because I am recording the audio of many of the presentations, I choose to stay in the main room, also the largest room.

**10:30am:** I begin streaming the Filesystems session, Chris Tyler is also in this room recording the video for posting later on the web.  The session did not start off all that interesting.  Near the end, I learned a bit about the transition from ext4 to btrfs for the future of Linux in general.

**11:30am:** This was my favoritest hour of the entire bar camp.  Luke Macken and John (J5) Palmieri presented on Moksha.  Moksha is an application built upon Turbo Gears 2, orbited, jQuery and about 10 other technologies to bring together a simple interface for making real time applications on the web.  It's much more than a simple AJAXified application and has benefits to allow one to write a simple connector to communicate to the browser.  Watch for another post on this in the near future.

**12:15pm:** During the Moksha talk, I recalled that I desired to head over to the Marriott hotel and take pictures of the Fedora window posters.  Because I hadn't brought along my camera, I first asked Mairin Duffy to see if she had a long range lense, She did not.  John Stanley informed me he had one with his Canon Digital Rebel XTI, and that he would happily lend it to me.  However, he couldn't leave as he was covering for others during the lunch hour.

**12:30pm:** Jennfer came over and spent about 20 minutes with me while I ate my lunch.  Then we found John together and headed out \*quickly\* to get the pictures of the hotel.  We talked about what she was going to do that day, visit some older churches in the area and such.

As we arrived at the hotel, we saw several windows with the Fedora window posters.  I pulled out the camera and fired away, catching several good photos.  After taking the first photos however, I noticed that the camera was reporting that it did not have a CF card.  It turns out John didn't know he didn't have a card in his camera, which means no pictures from the hotel experiment (unless others have some, here's hoping).

**1:33pm:** After hurrying back from the failed photo shoot.  I found myself running behind the schedule just a little.  It turns out the Puppet session was next and Jeroen van Meuween wasn't too interested in waiting on me.  As luck would have it, everyone seemed to be in this session and Ricky Zhou saved the day by recording the first few minutes on the stream for me.

The puppet session was good, but I wish I had seen a bit of a demo of advanced features.

**2:30pm:** The desktop session was started recording, however, I was asked to come out and do an interview with my good friend Dave Nalley about the progress of the Ambassadors with Colby Hoke.  We spent a good bit of time talking in front of the camera about the awesomeness that is the new AmbassadorKit, the new Media Box and some other initiatives coming soon to the Fedora Project.

**2:55pm:** Headed over to the remaining bits of the Git Basics session run by Paul Frields.  I really enjoyed this session.  While I know quite a bit about Git, I was able to help teach others about a few things and even learned a thing or two about git-reset.

**3:25pm:** Returned to the main room to finish up the streaming for the Desktop session.  There was a lot of discussion going on about the new feature in the GNOME (I think?) desktop, but coming in at the end, I wasn't certain.

**3:30pm:** After starting the recording for the KVM session, along with Kevin Fenzi, I headed over to the session we were holding on Fedora Classroom.  I was saddened to see that there were only 6 people (including us) in the session.  But that's what you get when you compete against KVM and other blockbuster sessions and your topic is really, really new.

Even with the small audience, Kevin and I were able to come up with some positive plans for the future from the group.  I anticipate we'll see more basic topics for the #fedora and FedoraForum.org crowds.  We talked about how a lot of the folks we've seen in the #fedora-classroom sessions over the past two months were those who really could become great contributors with just a bit of opportunity.

We also discussed ways to get more presenters and topics into the curriculum.  Part of what is keeping this from blooming quickly.  Hopefully the things we discussed were useful for the future of Fedora Classroom and its future does look bright.

**4:30pm:** As everyone gathered into the room, I learned that we were going to be having a hackfest in the evening after FUDPub.  The goal of the hackfest was to get the videos and audio uploaded and shared as quickly as possible.

**5:08pm:** Paul's final remarks for the bar camp, thanking many of the contributors.  I was grateful for everyone who put in effort today.  The MIT folks were very gracious for letting us hold FUDCon there this year.

Paul announced the FUDPub at Flat Top Johny's and that the OLPC folks were sponsoring the food and one drink.  Very nice of them as well.

Part 2 will be coming shortly as it is another day unto itself.

Cheers,

Herlo
