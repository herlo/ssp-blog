So we finally announced the [theme][1], [dates and venue][2] for the [Utah Open Source Conference 2009][3].  Looks to be fun to see what people will think of it and the presentations that will result.  The theme, Affordability, Scalability, Reliability seemed appropriate.  I hope others will see the value in it as well.

Looking forward, I'm thinking a lot about the tracks we'll be having at UTOSC 2009.  I'm wondering what others think, but I want to have at least Developer, Business and Beginner tracks.  I know that [Laura Moncur][4] and I have are already been discussing the beginner track, so that's very exciting.

So here's my thinking, if you want to see a particular presentation at UTOSC 2009, comment here, or on one of the blog posts on [utos.org][5].  In addition, when we put the call for papers out, we'll try to do a similar thing to other open source conferences, like [open source bridge][6], [linuxfest northwest][7] and others have done.  We'll show you all of the presentation submissions.  We're also hoping to alter our voting system to allow anyone who has _registered for the conference_ to vote for or against a particular presentation.

I'm getting really excited about the Utah Open Source Conference 2009.  I hope you all are too.

Cheers,

Herlo
