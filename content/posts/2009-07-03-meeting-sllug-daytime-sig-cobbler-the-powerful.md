HI all,

This month's SLLUG Daytime SIG meeting is this coming Wednesday, July 8, from 11:30am-1pm at BetaLoft.  I apologize for being slow getting this out, we've been working through a big datacenter move this past week at work.  Now that is over, it's time for SLLUG Daytime at BetaLoft, (357 W 200 S Suite 201 Salt Lake City, UT, 84101).  Here's a [map][1] if you need directions.

I'd like to let you all know that I (Herlo) will be presenting this month, and the topic is: Cobbler, the powerful, installation, dhcp, dns and repo server!

If you have ever wanted to setup a system with pxe, dhcp, customized repositories and more, then cobbler is for you.  Feel free to read up on the [cobbler website][2] before the meeting.

I should mention that cobbler supports several distributions of Linux, and will soon support Windows remote installation (using Linux RIS).  Albeit, I'll focus on setup of cobbler, a simple installation server with just one distro, using kvm and koan (kickstart over a network) with some basic networking and showing the gui tools as well.

Bring your lunch and your brains and learn all about setting up your very own install server in under an hour.

See you all on Wednesday!

Cheers,

Herlo
