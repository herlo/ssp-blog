It's strange, odd even.  I'm not quite sure how to react, but it is very weird to me.

[FUDCon Tempe 2011][1] is here in just a few short days.  Some of the people I would expect to attend, aren't going to be at FUDCon this year.  I am going to miss their presence immensely.

  * It's the first FUDCon without the master of karaoke, Greg DeKoenigsberg.  He'll be missing out on the warm weather and friendly collaboration for sure.
  * I know my good friend, David Nalley isn't going to make it either. I have been at so many Fedora events with him, it will sure be a bit lacking without his late nights and overall good nature.
  * I'm also saddened to hear that Karsten Wade won't be able to attend, he will surely be missed with his community insight and valuable opinions.

There are others, in fact, who I know probably would like to come.  These specific instances stood out to me because I think of them as amazing contributors.  Their consistent attendance at events like FUDCon have encouraged me to return year after year to events I now love. Mind you, the above folks I mentioned aren't missing from Fedora overall.  In fact, I know that each of them and many more who can't make FUDCon this coming weekend in person can still participate and contribute from afar (and will likely do so).

I see a new generation of contributor helping to grow Fedora into a grand new direction.  I'm interested in seeing where this road will take us, and I think that's the joy.  With each new contributor in a community like Fedora, we continue down the path of the best of free and open source software, but we can meander into realms we had never thought of before.  This is what excites me!

Like I said, I'm on my way to FUDCon Tempe for what is no doubt going to be an awesome event. Right now, I am sitting in my hotel in Flagstaff, Arizona.  A mere 151 miles, about 2 hours at 75mph, from the Courtyard in Tempe, Arizona, where most of our attendees will stay for four days.  I should easily be there by early afternoon tomorrow.

Mind you, this trip was planned for me to be eight days, two travel days to and from Salt Lake City.  Just this afternoon, we spent about 3.5 hours at the amazing Grand Canyon National Park.  If you get a chance to visit this amazing natural canyon, at 10 miles across, do it!  Our little family had a great time seeing the sights and riding the buses around.  By the way, dusk is really amazing at the park, don't miss that either.

See you all in just a few days!

Cheers,

Herlo
