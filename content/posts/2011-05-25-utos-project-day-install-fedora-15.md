Are you planning on attending the [UTOS Project Day][1] this Saturday, May 28? Come work on your projects in an open environment with food, friends and feedback.

Folks, since [Fedora 15 was just released yesterday][2], I had an idea regarding the [UTOS Project Day][3]. I'm going to setup an [installation server][4] and [usb keys][5] for anyone who wishes to try out and/or install Fedora 15 on their computer.

There are only a couple requirements:

  1. If you want the media on your USB key, you must provide at least a 2GB key. (Any existing data should be preserved, but make a backup just in case.)
  2. Installations will be done using network boot, which requires a PxE capable laptop. Most are these days, just make sure yours supports this feature.

[UTOS Project Day][3] is going to be tons of fun. Come on down and try out [Fedora 15][6], [work on your project.][7], or [help someone else work on theirs][8].

Here's to seeing all my geek friends this weekend at **UTOS Project Day**!!

Cheers,

Herlo
