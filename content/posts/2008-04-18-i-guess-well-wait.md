As many of you may already know, Fedora 9 (codename: Sulphur) has been <a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2008-April/msg00009.html" target="_blank">pushed back 2 weeks</a> to May 13.  Being the organizer of the <a href="http://www.utos.org/2008/04/03/utah-open-source-foundation-and-ubuntu-utah-bring-you-a-release-party-of-gigantic-proportion/" target="_blank">Utah Fedora/Ubuntu Linux Release Party</a> on May 3, its kind of hard to push it back because Ubuntu's release is still on time.

I'm glad though that the major parts of this release are <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/9/FeatureList" target="_blank">feature complete</a> and its just a few blocker bugs holding it back.  I'm also really happy to point out that because the folks at the Fedora Project are willing to push the date back, the release will be much better off in the end.

This also goes to show that while many businesses would consider releasing anyway.  Mainly because they promised something, and not releasing would cost them revenue and possible customers.  Open source people don't follow the same mantra, and I'm proud to say that while I like meeting deadlines, if deadlines slips a little to make a better product, timelines should slip.

**In the meantime**, enjoy the preview release made available yesterday.  Utah will party with <a href="http://torrent.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">this </a>_<a href="http://torrent.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">preview</a>.  S_hortly after the party, an update will be made available via **yum**.  There are some amazing things coming out in a few weeks.  Keep your ear to the ground and enjoy the new Sulphur in your life!

Cheers,

Herlo
