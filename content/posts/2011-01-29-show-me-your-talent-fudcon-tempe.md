This morning I, along with about 100 other attendees at FUDCon Tempe pitched our barcamp sessions.  You can find the schedule here.

However, my pitch was a bit different than the rest.  Throughout the rest of the sessions from now until Sunday noon, I'll be in room BYAC 190 to record your talent.  What I mean by this, is that I want you to come by and do a 5-15 minute presentation on your Fedora system that we can share with the community.

As an goal, I'm working to make videos that can help other Fedora contributors work toward gaining a larger skillset.  For example, a presentation on configuring a DNS caching server, configuring a simple smtp server, using Scribus, how to configure NetworkManager or SELinux basics could be good simple presentations.  As you can see, these topics could become very complex, but I'm mostly interested in the basics in these areas.

Once I get these recorded this weekend, I'll process them on Sunday and Monday.  My goal is to get them up on the Fedora website somewhere (more details to come) by early next week.  Watch for another blog post when I get them online.

I'd like to thank you in advance for coming by and spending 10-15 minutes sharing your knowledge with Fedora and the free software community.

Cheers,

Herlo
