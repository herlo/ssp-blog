Want a whole bunch of free stickers with software you love to use!?

I thought this was the neatest thing in a long time. Created by obvious lovers of Open Source and art fanatics. Javier A. Albusac JimÃ©nez holds the copyright (MIT license) so you can share these stickers, make more, etc. It sure is fun to play with these stickers!

Check them out here.  The site has instructions on how to print them and cut them out so they look professional.

Also, you can download the book directly if you prefer:

I am going to my local office depot very soon!

Cheers,
