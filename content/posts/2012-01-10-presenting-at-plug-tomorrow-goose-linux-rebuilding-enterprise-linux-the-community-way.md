Well, this has been a long time coming. It's taken over 6 months of hard work by our community. Tomorrow night, January 11, 2012, I will stand in front of the [Provo Linux User Group (PLUG)][1] and talk about what we have been working toward.

## GoOSe Linux – Rebuilding Enterprise Linux the Community Way

Yes, GoOSe Linux is almost here and we're ready to discuss the process and the goals of our little community. If you have been hearing me rant about GoOSe on the Utah Open Source Planet, Google Plus or Facebook and want to hear more. Or if you are just plain bored tomorrow night with nothing better to do, come down to the Provo Linux User Group. Learn more about how the Enterprise Linux Rebuild community is working together to make a better ecosystem.

If you can't make it, or want to preview the slides, you can get them on my [speakerdeck.com][2] page. I look forward to seeing you all there.
