Hi all,

Just a quick reminder that this Saturday and Sunday from 12:00 UTC until 16:00 UTC will be the [Fedora Classroom][1] sessions.  A few adjustments have been made to make things run smoother, but the sessions are still one hour, now with a 15 minute break in between.  If you are unfamiliar with IRC, there's a [helpful guide][2] to get you started.

We still need volunteers to cover 3 sessions on Sunday.  If you have something to share, please sign up today.  The sessions can be as simple as you wish, the idea being we want to help users understand more about how Fedora works.  Maybe a session on the new features in Fedora 10?

Hope to see you all there.  I'll be doing a class on 'Creating Logical Volumes' and I'm excited to do it!

Cheers,

Herlo
