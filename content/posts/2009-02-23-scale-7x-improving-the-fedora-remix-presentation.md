After getting permission from Paul W. Frields, the fearless Fedora Project Leader to use [his slides][1] to present the topic of Fedora Remix, I began to add and modify the presentation. I could see that some things had needed changing, this included changes to the look and feel.  Let me share with you these changes and improvements.

  * **Legal**: The largest change was to the legal section, previously there wasn't one mainly due to the fact that when Paul presented it at UTOSC 2008, the [Fedora Remix secondary trademark][2] was not yet available. 
      * For instance, one can now create a Fedora Remix and label it as such without asking permission of the Fedora Project or Red Hat
      * There are now [clear guidelines as to the distribution][3] of such Remixes, which will make it easier to protect the Fedora trademark.
  * **Artwork**: The new Fedora Remix art allowed me to update the slides to include examples of some of the Fedora Remix logos (and one at the end with the [four foundations][4]) on every page as an OpenOffice.org Impress master slide set.  Maybe I will make these into templates one day if I decide to learn how.
  * **Approach**:  When Paul did his presentation, I recalled he built an install DVD using [pungi][5], but I felt it more appropriate to show a LiveCD being built which then let me reboot into a LiveUSB after converting it with livecd-iso-to-disk. 
      * An additional thought I considered with my approach here (after I was done presentting, of course) would be to add the impress or pdf presentation loaded up in the Live Image.
      * Also, a true Fedora Remix would be nice with packages that I've created (or someone else's repo that's FOSS) to show the actual proof in the pudding.

I felt it went very smoothly and was quite useful.  I expect that the recorded version (I think they recorded it to video from what I recall) will be out in a short while.  I expect that a few folks will take these very simple tools and get some cool Fedora Remixes in the works.

I look forward to seeing more Fedora Remix presentations in the future.

Cheers,

Herlo
