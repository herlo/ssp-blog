I'm looking for someone to print out flyers and take them to local colleges in the Mountain West to promote UTOSC 2009.  This includes Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Nevada.  I'm willing to give out free passes to [UTOSC 2009][1] to **anyone** who helps out with this project.  Would you be interested?

And if you know anyone else who might be interested, that would be useful as well.

If you are, or know of someone, who is interested in helping print and pass out flyers for UTOSC 2009, please send an email to <volunteer@utos.org> with the subject line 'UTOSC 2009 Flyers'.  Include the college you attend so we can keep track of the schools we have distributed flyers.  This is a first-come-first-served kind of opportunity, so act fast!!

Cheers,

Clint
