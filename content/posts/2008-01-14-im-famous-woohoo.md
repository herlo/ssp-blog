So for those of you who follow this blog, its not the first time I've done shameless self-promotion. However, in this case, its only after the fact that someone else thought I was important.

I want to say thank you to the <a href="http://voxpopdesign.com/wordpress/" target="_blank">CodeAway</a> and their organizers (Matthew Reinbold, and others, I'm sure) for putting me on this list. I hope to prove them right and kick some tail in Utah Open Source and around the tech community this year. I'm also glad to see at least a couple of faces I recognize, which means I need to meet the others on this list and get them involved in <a href="http://utosf.org" target="_blank">UTOSF</a> and the <a href="http://utosc.com" target="_blank">UTOSC</a> for sure.

Here's the article: <a href="http://voxpopdesign.com/wordpress/?p=104" target="_blank">http://voxpopdesign.com/wordpress/?p=104</a>

Cheers,

Herlo
