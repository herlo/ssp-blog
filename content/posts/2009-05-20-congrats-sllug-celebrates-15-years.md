I wanted to personally congratulate the [Salt Lake Linux User Group][1] on 15 years of Linux education and community.  It's exciting to see such a strong following!  Thanks for all the hard work everyone has put into making SLLUG such a great group.

Here's the [email][2] from Marc Christensen:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  The Salt Lake Linux Users Group started its humble beginnings sometime in May of 1994.  A few weeks later we officially incorporated as a non-profit on July 28, 1994. That makes this month our 15th year soft-anniversary with the official one coming up in July.  It also makes SLLUG one of the oldest and most established Linux user groups in the world!

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Congratulations to everyone one for making SLLUG a success and contributing to such a great Local Linux community.  We have members of our group that have greatly influenced and contributed heavily to Linux over the years.  We make up a diverse group of individuals of varied backgrounds and depth of knowledge.
