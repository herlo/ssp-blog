The following two articles were published in the past couple days.  When they were published and made known to me, I was saddened:

<a title="Report: OLPC may eventually switch from Linux to Windows XP" href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9079798" target="_blank">Report: OLPC may eventually switch from Linux to Windows XP</a>
  
[Nicholas Negroponte on Sugar and One Laptop Per Child][1]

It appears, that <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/GregDeKoenigsberg" target="_blank">Greg DeKoenigsberg</a> responded (it appears) to these two articles with a great rebuttal in this article:

<a title="Thank you Greg" href="http://gregdek.livejournal.com/26184.html" target="_blank">OLPC Developers are *not* fundamentalists</a>

Thank you Greg, thank you for saying what I feel inside.  As an open source advocate, I see the value and benefit of free software and its power.  I feel good inside when I contribute and don't feel anything like a fundamentalist.

Again, thank you Greg.

Cheers,

Herlo
