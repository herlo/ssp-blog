One of the things I've been working pretty heavily on the past couple weeks is getting more involved in the Fedora Ambassador program.  And let's just say its been a blast.  I love the new direction of the North American Ambassador program and am excited to be a part of the newly rejuvenated program.

A couple reasons more why I'm extremely excited have to do with the people I'm working with, Alex Maier, GregDek, <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/JeffreyTadlock" target="_blank">Jeffrey Tadlock</a>, <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DavidNalley" target="_blank">David Nalley</a>, <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Inode0" target="_blank">John Rose</a> and <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Rashadul" target="_blank">Rashadul Islam</a> among others.  Each of these folks is a leader in their own right, and I've especially enjoyed working with David Nalley.

He and I have been working hard to reshape and reinvigorate the NA Ambassadors program.  I suspect others are working tirelessly as well, and I'm excited about that prospect.  David and I are the architects of the new 'Regional Ambassadors' in North America.  The idea is to work in our respective regions to get a Fedora Ambassador in every State/Province.  Once we've done that, we'll start working toward major metropolitan areas.  The regional ambassadors currently assigned are:

  * Eastern US: David Nalley
  * Central US: John Rose
  * Western US: <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Herlo" target="_blank">Clint Savage</a>
  * Canada: Rashadul Islam

This doesn't mean that we've limited the regions to these areas, just that they are a good start.  Regional ambassadors will be the central point of contact, distribution of swag, etc. for each ambassador in that region.  The goal is to make it easier for Ambassadors to go out to events and promote Fedora.  Regional ambassadors will also be responsible for mentoring, providing tools, media, swag, etc. for each ambassador.  All the things needed to make Fedora look like the world class organization it has become.

In the next week or so, I'll be sending out an email to all of the Ambassadors I can find in the western US.  If you don't get an email from me soon, feel free to email me and we'll get you going.  The plan is to get your opinions, have you start coming to meetings and join the mailing list.  Participate where you can, and we'll help you grow your state/province/city.

As NA Ambassadors, we've set new goals too, here's the bullet points:

  * Contacting existing Ambassadors
  * Mentoring new and existing Ambassadors 
      * Help to remember **why** they joined ambassadors in the first place
  * Delivering media in a more timely and better process
  * Working closely with FAMSCo to get a good budget to help NA Ambassadors expected growth

We'll be discussing much of this at our next NA Ambassadors meeting, as well as progress on contacting all of the current ambassadors.  If you are interested in participating, join us at #fedora-meeting on Wednesday July 30 @ 1am UTC (Tuesday 9pm EDT).  Current <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors/Meetings/2008-07-30" target="_blank">agenda</a> and <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors/NA" target="_blank">task list</a> are being formed now, so feel free to contribute.

Cheers,
