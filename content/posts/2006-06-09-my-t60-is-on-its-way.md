So I checked my email today, and noticed my lovely Thinkpad T60 I ordered last week is really on its way.

Here is the status from UPS:

<table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
  <tr class="pi-r1-rwo">
    <td class="pi-r1-pad">
      LOUISVILLE, KY, US
    </td>
    
    <td class="pi-r1-pad">
      06/09/2006
    </td>
    
    <td class="pi-r1-pad">
      1:45 P.M.
    </td>
    
    <td class="pi-r1-pad">
      THIS SHIPMENT IS WAREHOUSED UNTIL IT IS RELEASED BY CLEARING AGENCY;BROKERAGE RELEASED SHIPMENT. SHIPMENT IS SUBMITTED TO CLEARING AGENCY FOR FURTHER CLEARANCE
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Anyway, I am really stoked!! I hope it clears customs soon.
  
Here's the specs of my new computer. I plan on really using most of the power too!!

<span class="small">Intel Core Duo processor T2500 2.0GHz</span>

<span class="small">1 GB (667Mhz) DDR2 SDRAM</span>

100 GB 7200RPM SATA HD

DVD-R 24X

<span class="small">ATI Mobility FireGL V5200 256MB UXGA</span>

Plus it has Bluetooth, IR, GB Ethernet, 802.11 no cat, sound (and EVDO wireless wan which I might be able to use when Sprint gets their act together).

I got it for just under $2800, I think it was well worth it.
